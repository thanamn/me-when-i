## 1.1 Introduction to the Meme as Object of Study

The meme under examination—a low-resolution image of Apple CEO Tim Cook captioned only with the phrase "Me When I"—may initially appear trivial or nonsensical. However, its very incompleteness and ambiguity make it a compelling artifact for scholarly analysis. In the context of digital culture, memes function as a form of participatory media, where meaning is co-constructed by creators and audiences. This participatory nature is central to the dynamics of digital culture, as highlighted by Jenkins in *Convergence Culture*. Jenkins argues that the convergence of media platforms enables users to actively engage with and reinterpret cultural artifacts, transforming them into collective expressions of shared meaning (Jenkins 3). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this phenomenon, as its open-endedness invites endless reinterpretations and adaptations by online communities. For instance, similar memes such as the "Distracted Boyfriend" or "Woman Yelling at a Cat" have thrived on their ability to be endlessly remixed and recontextualized, demonstrating the participatory ethos of meme culture.

This particular meme, by refusing to complete its thought, exemplifies a form of post-ironic humor that thrives on digital platforms. As Sontag suggests in her discussion of camp, the aesthetic of failure or incompleteness can itself be a source of meaning (Sontag 277). Similarly, the meme's lo-fi quality and lack of a traditional punchline align with Ngai's concept of the "stuplime," where the banal and the absurd intersect to provoke both frustration and fascination (Ngai 271). Furthermore, Henry Jenkins’ concept of "convergence culture" highlights how memes like this one thrive in a participatory digital ecosystem, where users collectively shape and reinterpret meaning.

Additionally, the "Me When I" meme can be situated within the broader context of internet humor, which often relies on shared cultural knowledge and implicit understanding. This aligns with Roland Barthes’ notion of the "readerly" and "writerly" text, where the audience plays an active role in constructing meaning (Barthes 4). The meme’s incompleteness also resonates with Derrida’s concept of différance, which emphasizes the perpetual deferral of meaning in language. By engaging with theories of semiotics, linguistic fragmentation, and affect, this chapter argues that the "Me When I" meme encapsulates broader cultural trends of irony, digital fragmentation, and the aesthetics of incompletion.

Moreover, the meme’s popularity underscores the role of digital platforms in shaping contemporary humor. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram, where brevity and immediacy are prioritized, create an environment where incomplete or ambiguous content can thrive. This phenomenon can be linked to McLuhan’s assertion that "the medium is the message," as the structure of these platforms influences the types of content that gain traction. The "Me When I" meme, with its minimalist format, exemplifies how digital media encourage new forms of expression that challenge traditional notions of coherence and completeness. McLuhan’s insights also suggest that the meme’s success is not merely a product of its content but of the medium through which it is disseminated, highlighting the interplay between form and function in digital communication.

Furthermore, the "Me When I" meme reflects a broader cultural shift toward valuing interpretive engagement over explicit messaging. This shift is emblematic of a post-ironic sensibility, where the boundaries between sincerity and absurdity are deliberately blurred. The meme’s open-endedness invites viewers to project their own experiences and emotions onto it, creating a deeply personal yet collectively shared form of humor. This participatory dynamic underscores the democratizing potential of digital media, where users are not merely passive consumers but active co-creators of meaning. By examining the "Me When I" meme through this lens, we can better understand how digital culture fosters new modes of communication that prioritize ambiguity, interactivity, and collective interpretation.

## 1.2 The Meme Itself

*Figure 1.1: The "Me When I" meme featuring Tim Cook*

The "Me When I" meme features a low-resolution image of Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, captured in an unremarkable moment. The photograph is grainy, with muted colors and no apparent effort to enhance its visual appeal. Superimposed on this image is the incomplete caption "Me When I," rendered in a plain, sans-serif font. The absence of a punchline or any additional context leaves the viewer in a state of interpretive suspension. This lo-fi aesthetic, characterized by its deliberate rejection of polish and professionalism, aligns with the broader trend in digital culture toward what Barthes might describe as the "punctum"—a detail that disrupts conventional meaning and invites personal engagement (Barthes 27). Hito Steyerl’s *In Defense of the Poor Image* further contextualizes this aesthetic, arguing that low-resolution visuals democratize media by prioritizing accessibility over quality.

The meme’s refusal to complete its thought exemplifies the post-ironic sensibility prevalent in contemporary internet culture. As Jameson notes in his analysis of postmodernism, the fragmentation of traditional narrative structures often serves to reflect the disjointed and decentralized nature of late capitalist society (Jameson 25). Similarly, the "Me When I" meme resists closure, instead inviting viewers to project their own meanings onto its incomplete framework. This interplay between image and text, where neither fully resolves the other, underscores the meme’s role as a site of participatory meaning-making. Umberto Eco’s *The Open Work* provides additional insight, suggesting that the interpretive openness of such artifacts engages audiences in active co-creation of meaning.

Moreover, the meme’s aesthetic can be linked to the broader cultural phenomenon of "poor images," as described by Steyerl. These images, often circulated widely online, challenge traditional hierarchies of visual quality and cultural value. By embracing ambiguity and incompletion, the meme becomes a microcosm of post-ironic digital expression, where the boundaries between sincerity and absurdity are deliberately blurred. This aesthetic choice also reflects the democratization of media production, where anyone with basic tools can create and share content that resonates on a global scale. The accessibility of tools like Photoshop or even basic meme generators has lowered the barriers to entry for cultural production, enabling a wider range of voices to participate in the creation of digital artifacts.

The visual simplicity of the meme also invites comparisons to minimalist art, which often seeks to strip away extraneous elements to focus on core ideas. In this sense, the "Me When I" meme can be seen as a digital counterpart to works by artists like Donald Judd or Agnes Martin, who emphasized the power of simplicity and repetition. This connection highlights how digital culture often reinterprets and repurposes aesthetic principles from other artistic traditions. The meme’s minimalist aesthetic, much like minimalist art, challenges viewers to find meaning in what is absent rather than what is present, creating a space for introspection and personal interpretation.

Additionally, the lo-fi aesthetic of the meme can be understood as a critique of the hyper-polished visuals that dominate corporate and mainstream media. By embracing imperfection, the meme aligns itself with a broader cultural movement that values authenticity and relatability over perfection. This aesthetic choice resonates with the ethos of digital subcultures, where the rejection of traditional standards of quality becomes a form of resistance against the commodification of culture. The "Me When I" meme, in its raw and unpolished form, invites viewers to engage with it on a more personal and emotional level, fostering a sense of intimacy and connection that is often absent in highly produced media.

Furthermore, the meme’s minimalist design and lo-fi aesthetic can be seen as a reflection of the constraints and affordances of digital platforms. On platforms like Twitter and Instagram, where brevity and immediacy are prioritized, the simplicity of the "Me When I" meme allows it to stand out and resonate with audiences. This interplay between aesthetic choices and platform dynamics underscores the importance of considering the technological and cultural contexts in which digital artifacts are created and disseminated. By examining the "Me When I" meme through this lens, we can gain a deeper understanding of how digital culture shapes and is shaped by the tools and platforms that facilitate its expression.

## 1.3 Research Questions & Objectives

This thesis seeks to interrogate the cultural and theoretical implications of the "Me When I" meme, focusing on its unfinished nature and the questions it raises about language, meaning, and irony in digital media. The following research questions guide this inquiry:

1. What does the deliberate incompletion of the "Me When I" meme express about contemporary modes of communication and humor in digital culture?
2. How does the interplay of image and text in this meme challenge traditional semiotic frameworks, as discussed by Barthes in his exploration of the "image-text" relationship (Barthes 38)?
3. In what ways does the meme’s post-ironic sensibility reflect broader cultural trends of affective engagement and detachment, as theorized by Sontag and Ngai?
4. How does the lo-fi aesthetic of the meme contribute to its meaning, and what does this suggest about the role of visual quality in digital expression?

The primary objective of this thesis is to treat the "Me When I" meme as a serious artifact of digital culture, using it as a lens to explore the fragmentation of language and meaning in postmodern contexts. By applying methodologies from semiotics, linguistic analysis, and cultural theory, this study aims to uncover how the meme encapsulates the paradoxes of digital communication: its simultaneous reliance on and subversion of traditional forms of expression. Marshall McLuhan’s *Understanding Media* provides a broader framework for analyzing how digital platforms shape the production and reception of such memes, emphasizing their role as extensions of human communication.

Additionally, this thesis aims to contribute to the growing field of internet studies by highlighting the cultural significance of seemingly trivial digital artifacts. By examining the "Me When I" meme through multiple theoretical lenses, this study seeks to demonstrate how such artifacts can offer valuable insights into the complexities of contemporary digital culture. Ultimately, this thesis argues that the "Me When I" meme exemplifies the aesthetics of incompletion, serving as a microcosm of the tensions between sincerity and absurdity, coherence and fragmentation, in post-ironic digital culture.

Furthermore, the research questions outlined above are not only relevant to the study of memes but also to broader discussions in media and cultural studies. For instance, the question of how incompletion functions as a mode of communication can be linked to Derrida’s concept of différance, which challenges the notion of fixed meaning in language. Similarly, the exploration of post-ironic sensibilities aligns with Ngai’s analysis of affective states that blur the boundaries between emotional engagement and detachment. By situating the "Me When I" meme within these theoretical frameworks, this thesis aims to bridge the gap between the study of digital artifacts and established academic discourses on language, aesthetics, and culture.

Moreover, the objectives of this thesis extend beyond the analysis of a single meme. By treating the "Me When I" meme as a case study, this research seeks to develop a methodological framework that can be applied to other digital artifacts. This approach underscores the interdisciplinary nature of meme studies, which draws on insights from semiotics, visual culture, and affect theory to address the unique challenges posed by digital media. Ultimately, this thesis aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how digital culture reflects and shapes contemporary modes of communication, creativity, and expression.

## 1.4 Methodology

This thesis employs a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the "Me When I" meme, drawing on semiotics, linguistic deconstruction, and visual culture analysis. Each method is carefully chosen to address the unique characteristics of the meme and its cultural significance.

First, a semiotic reading is applied to examine the interplay between the image and text, following Barthes’ framework of the "image-text" relationship (Barthes 38). This method allows for an exploration of how meaning is constructed—or deliberately left incomplete—within the meme’s visual and linguistic elements. Clifford Geertz’s *The Interpretation of Cultures* further justifies this approach by emphasizing the importance of thick description in understanding cultural artifacts. By employing semiotics, this study seeks to uncover the layers of meaning embedded in the meme’s minimalist design, highlighting how its visual and textual elements interact to create a space for interpretive engagement.

Second, linguistic deconstruction is used to analyze the fragmented caption "Me When I." Drawing on Derrida’s theories of différance and the instability of meaning, this method interrogates how the meme’s unfinished text disrupts conventional linguistic expectations and invites interpretive engagement. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of digital communication, where brevity and fragmentation are often the norm. By applying deconstruction, this study aims to reveal how the meme’s linguistic incompletion serves as a critique of traditional modes of communication, emphasizing the fluidity and multiplicity of meaning in digital culture.

Finally, visual culture analysis is employed to contextualize the meme within broader trends in digital aesthetics. By examining its lo-fi quality and post-ironic sensibility, this method situates the meme within the aesthetic and cultural frameworks discussed by theorists such as Sontag and Ngai. Lev Manovich’s *The Language of New Media* provides additional insights into how digital platforms influence the visual and cultural characteristics of memes. This approach also considers the role of digital platforms in shaping the aesthetic choices of meme creators, highlighting how technological affordances and constraints impact the production and dissemination of visual content.

Throughout this analysis, real published theories and academic sources are used to ground the discussion in established scholarship. This methodological framework ensures a rigorous and comprehensive examination of the "Me When I" meme as a significant artifact of post-ironic digital culture. Furthermore, this approach highlights the interdisciplinary nature of meme studies, bridging the fields of media studies, cultural theory, and visual analysis. By integrating these methodologies, this thesis aims to provide a holistic understanding of the "Me When I" meme, demonstrating how its visual, linguistic, and cultural dimensions intersect to create a complex and multifaceted artifact.
