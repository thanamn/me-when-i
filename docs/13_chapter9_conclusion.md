# Chapter 9: Conclusion - Incompletion as Cultural Expression

## 9.1 Summary of Findings

This thesis has examined the "Me When I" meme as a cultural artifact that encapsulates the fragmented, participatory, and absurdist dynamics of digital culture. By analyzing the meme through the lenses of linguistic fragmentation, affect theory, lo-fi aesthetics, symbolic representation, and critical theory, this study has demonstrated how the meme operates as a site of meaning-making that reflects broader cultural and communicative trends in the digital age.

The analysis began with an exploration of linguistic fragmentation in Chapter 3, highlighting how the incomplete caption "Me When I" exemplifies the breakdown of traditional linguistic structures in digital communication. Drawing on Derrida’s concept of différance and Barthes’ theory of the writerly text, this chapter argued that the meme’s open-endedness invites viewers to actively participate in the construction of meaning. By leaving its narrative unresolved, the meme transforms its audience into co-creators, reflecting the participatory nature of digital culture.

Affect theory provided another critical framework for understanding the meme’s cultural significance, as explored in Chapter 7. By referencing scholars like Massumi, Ahmed, and Berlant, this chapter demonstrated how the "Me When I" meme operates as an affective template that allows users to project their own emotions and experiences onto its ambiguous structure. The meme’s absurdity and incompletion amplify its emotional resonance, creating a shared space for humor, identification, and collective expression. This affective dimension underscores the role of memes as tools for navigating the complexities of digital selfhood and social interaction.

The visual degradation and lo-fi aesthetics of the "Me When I" meme were analyzed in Chapter 5, situating the meme within broader trends in digital aesthetics. By drawing on Sontag’s concept of camp and Benjamin’s theory of aura, this chapter argued that the meme’s low-resolution imagery and minimalist design contribute to its cultural appeal. The lo-fi aesthetic not only enhances the meme’s absurdist qualities but also reflects a broader cultural embrace of imperfection and authenticity in digital media.

Chapter 4 focused on the symbolic significance of Tim Cook as the central figure in the meme. By analyzing Cook’s public persona and its juxtaposition with the meme’s absurdist context, this chapter demonstrated how the meme subverts traditional notions of authority and professionalism. The incongruity between Cook’s corporate image and the meme’s nonsensical caption creates a space for humor and critique, reflecting the subversive potential of memes as cultural artifacts.

The application of critical theory in Chapter 6 provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the meme’s cultural significance. By engaging with theorists like Baudrillard, Jameson, and Ngai, this chapter explored how the "Me When I" meme operates within the hyperreal conditions of postmodern media culture. The meme’s iterative and participatory nature exemplifies the depthlessness and fragmentation that characterize digital communication, positioning it as a dynamic and subversive artifact of the digital age.

Finally, the theme of absurdism emerged as a unifying thread throughout the thesis, culminating in the discussions of Chapters 8 and 9. By drawing on Camus’ philosophy of the absurd and Sontag’s concept of camp, this study demonstrated how the "Me When I" meme leverages its nonsensical and incongruous elements to challenge traditional expectations of coherence and meaning. The meme’s absurdist qualities not only enhance its humor but also serve as a form of cultural critique, reflecting the fragmented and chaotic nature of digital culture.

Together, these analytical threads reveal the "Me When I" meme as a multifaceted artifact that encapsulates the complexities of digital communication and culture. Its linguistic fragmentation, affective resonance, lo-fi aesthetics, symbolic subversion, theoretical depth, and absurdist humor work in concert to create a dynamic and participatory space for meaning-making. By engaging with these dimensions, this thesis has demonstrated how the "Me When I" meme operates as a cultural expression of incompletion, reflecting the broader dynamics of post-ironic digital culture.

## 9.2 Reasserting the Value of Absurd and Incomplete Memes

The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and absurdist qualities, exemplifies a broader category of digital artifacts that challenge traditional notions of coherence, meaning, and cultural value. Despite their apparent simplicity and nonsensical nature, such memes deserve serious academic analysis for their ability to reflect and shape the dynamics of digital culture. By engaging with these artifacts, scholars can uncover critical insights into the ways in which humor, identity, and communication are negotiated in the digital age.

One of the primary reasons incomplete and absurd memes warrant scholarly attention is their capacity to disrupt traditional hierarchies of cultural production. As Limor Shifman argues in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes democratize the creation and dissemination of cultural content, transforming audiences into active participants in the meaning-making process (Shifman 41). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness exemplifies this dynamic by inviting users to complete its narrative with their own interpretations, fostering a participatory model of cultural production. This process not only challenges the authority of traditional media gatekeepers but also highlights the ways in which digital culture empowers individuals to contribute to collective cultural expression.

The absurdist nature of memes like "Me When I" also serves as a form of cultural critique, reflecting the fragmented and chaotic nature of contemporary media environments. Drawing on Jean Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality, these memes operate within a space where representations detach from reality and circulate as self-referential simulacra (Baudrillard 6). The "Me When I" meme’s nonsensical and incongruous elements exemplify this condition, using humor to subvert conventional expectations of coherence and meaning. By embracing absurdity, such memes challenge audiences to confront the instability and fluidity of meaning in a media-saturated society.

Susan Sontag’s concept of camp provides another lens for understanding the cultural value of absurd and incomplete memes. In *Notes on Camp*, Sontag describes camp as a sensibility that values exaggeration, artifice, and the subversion of seriousness (Sontag 277). The "Me When I" meme’s minimalist absurdity aligns with this sensibility, using humor and incongruity to critique traditional notions of cultural value and seriousness. By engaging with these memes, scholars can explore how digital culture redefines the boundaries between high and low art, seriousness and play, and coherence and nonsense.

Moreover, incomplete and absurd memes offer valuable insights into the affective dimensions of digital communication. As Sara Ahmed argues in *The Cultural Politics of Emotion*, emotions play a central role in shaping how individuals engage with cultural artifacts and with one another (Ahmed 10). The "Me When I" meme’s ambiguity and absurdity create a space for emotional projection, allowing users to imbue the meme with their own feelings and experiences. This affective resonance underscores the role of memes as tools for navigating the complexities of digital selfhood and social interaction, making them a rich site for scholarly inquiry.

Finally, the study of incomplete and absurd memes contributes to broader discussions about the role of humor in cultural and media studies. As Simon Critchley notes in *On Humour*, humor has the capacity to reveal the incongruities and contradictions of social life, offering a means of both critique and connection (Critchley 12). The "Me When I" meme’s absurdist humor exemplifies this potential, using its nonsensical structure to engage audiences in a playful yet critical dialogue about the nature of meaning, identity, and communication in the digital age.

In conclusion, incomplete and absurd memes like "Me When I" deserve serious academic analysis for their ability to reflect and shape the dynamics of digital culture. By democratizing cultural production, subverting traditional expectations of coherence and meaning, and fostering affective and humorous engagement, these memes offer valuable insights into the complexities of contemporary media environments. As digital culture continues to evolve, the study of such artifacts will remain essential for understanding the ways in which individuals navigate and make sense of the fragmented and participatory landscape of the digital age.

## 9.3 Final Reflections: What “Me When I” Tells Us About Ourselves

The "Me When I" meme, in its simplicity and absurdity, offers profound insights into the nature of digital identity, humor, emotion, and the cultural anxieties that define our contemporary moment. As a cultural artifact, it reflects the fragmented, participatory, and affective dynamics of digital life, inviting us to consider how we construct meaning, navigate selfhood, and engage with the absurd in an increasingly mediated world.

At its core, the "Me When I" meme reveals the fluid and performative nature of digital identity. As Judith Butler argues in *Gender Trouble*, identity is not a fixed essence but a series of performative acts that are constantly negotiated and redefined (Butler 25). The meme’s open-ended caption and participatory structure exemplify this dynamic, allowing users to project their own narratives and emotions onto its ambiguous framework. In doing so, the meme becomes a mirror for the multiplicity of identities that individuals construct and perform in digital spaces. It underscores the ways in which digital culture enables fluidity and experimentation, while also highlighting the tensions and anxieties that arise from the constant negotiation of selfhood in a fragmented and hyperconnected world.

The humor of the "Me When I" meme also speaks to deeper cultural and philosophical questions about the role of absurdity in human experience. Drawing on Albert Camus’ philosophy of the absurd, the meme invites us to confront the tension between our search for meaning and the inherent ambiguity of the digital landscape (Camus 28). Its nonsensical structure and incomplete narrative reflect the chaotic and often incoherent nature of online communication, using humor as a means of navigating this dissonance. As Simon Critchley notes in *On Humour*, humor has the capacity to reveal the incongruities and contradictions of social life, offering a way to cope with the absurdity of existence (Critchley 12). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this potential, using its absurdist humor to create a shared space for laughter, reflection, and connection.

Emotion plays a central role in the cultural resonance of the "Me When I" meme, highlighting the affective dimensions of digital communication. As Sara Ahmed argues in *The Cultural Politics of Emotion*, emotions are not just personal experiences but social and cultural phenomena that shape how we engage with the world and with one another (Ahmed 10). The meme’s ambiguity and absurdity create a space for emotional projection, allowing users to imbue it with their own feelings and experiences. This affective resonance underscores the role of memes as tools for navigating the complexities of digital selfhood and social interaction, offering a means of both individual expression and collective identification.

Finally, the "Me When I" meme reflects broader cultural anxieties about coherence, meaning, and authenticity in the digital age. As Jean Baudrillard argues in *Simulacra and Simulation*, the proliferation of signs and symbols in a media-saturated society creates a hyperreal condition where meaning becomes fluid and contingent (Baudrillard 6). The meme’s nonsensical and incongruous elements exemplify this condition, using humor to subvert traditional expectations of coherence and meaning. At the same time, its lo-fi aesthetic and minimalist design reflect a cultural embrace of imperfection and authenticity, offering a counterpoint to the polished and curated images that dominate digital media. In this sense, the "Me When I" meme serves as both a critique of and a response to the anxieties of digital culture, using absurdity and incompletion to navigate the tensions between fragmentation and connection, chaos and coherence.

In reflecting on the "Me When I" meme, we are invited to consider not only what it says about digital culture but also what it reveals about ourselves. Its humor, ambiguity, and participatory nature challenge us to confront the complexities of identity, emotion, and meaning in a mediated world, offering a space for both critique and connection. As a cultural artifact, it reminds us that even in the absurd and the incomplete, there is potential for creativity, reflection, and shared understanding.

## 9.4 Future Directions in Meme and Internet Studies

As digital culture continues to evolve, the study of memes offers fertile ground for exploring new dimensions of communication, identity, and cultural production. The "Me When I" meme, with its absurdist and participatory qualities, exemplifies the dynamic and multifaceted nature of memes as cultural artifacts. Building on the insights of this thesis, future research in meme studies could address several emerging areas of interest, including AI-generated memes, non-textual and post-verbal memes, transnational meme flows, and the affective dimensions of digital media.

One promising avenue for future research is the study of AI-generated memes and their implications for creativity, authorship, and cultural production. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital culture, tools like DALL·E and ChatGPT are enabling the automated generation of meme content. These technologies raise important questions about the role of human agency in cultural production and the ways in which AI-generated memes might challenge traditional notions of creativity and originality. Scholars could explore how these memes are received and interpreted by audiences, as well as their potential to disrupt or reinforce existing cultural norms and power dynamics.

Another area of interest is the rise of non-textual and post-verbal memes, which rely on visual, auditory, or gestural elements rather than written language to convey meaning. Examples include reaction GIFs, TikTok trends, and emoji-based communication, all of which reflect the increasing prominence of multimodal and non-linear forms of expression in digital culture. By analyzing these memes, researchers can gain insights into how meaning is constructed and shared in ways that transcend linguistic boundaries, highlighting the evolving nature of digital communication.

The global circulation of memes also warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of transnational and cross-cultural flows of digital content. Memes often transcend national and linguistic boundaries, adapting to local contexts while retaining elements of their original meaning. This phenomenon raises questions about the dynamics of cultural exchange, appropriation, and hybridization in the digital age. Future studies could examine how memes are localized and reinterpreted across different cultural contexts, as well as the role of global platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok in facilitating these processes.

Affective media and the emotional dimensions of meme culture represent another critical area for future research. As Sara Ahmed argues in *The Cultural Politics of Emotion*, emotions are central to how individuals engage with cultural artifacts and with one another (Ahmed 10). Memes, as affective media, create spaces for emotional expression, projection, and connection, often amplifying feelings of humor, nostalgia, or solidarity. Scholars could explore how memes function as tools for navigating emotional experiences in digital spaces, as well as their potential to foster empathy, community, or polarization.

Finally, the intersection of meme studies with other disciplines, such as political science, sociology, and media ecology, offers opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Memes play a significant role in shaping public discourse, influencing political movements, and reflecting societal values. By integrating perspectives from multiple fields, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the cultural, social, and technological forces that shape meme culture.

In conclusion, the study of memes is a rapidly evolving field that reflects the complexities and contradictions of digital culture. By addressing emerging areas such as AI-generated memes, non-textual communication, global meme circulation, and affective media, future research can deepen our understanding of how memes function as dynamic and participatory artifacts of the digital age. As digital culture continues to transform, the study of memes will remain an essential lens for examining the ways in which individuals and communities navigate, negotiate, and make sense of the mediated world.
