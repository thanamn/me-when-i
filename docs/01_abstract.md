# Abstract

This thesis critically examines the "Me When I" meme, a low-resolution image of Apple CEO Tim Cook paired with an incomplete caption, as a significant artifact of post-ironic digital culture. While seemingly nonsensical, the meme is analyzed as a site of cultural expression that encapsulates the fragmented, participatory, and affective dynamics of online communication. By employing methodologies from meme studies, semiotics, internet linguistics, and cultural theory, this research explores how the meme’s absurdity and incompletion function as deliberate modes of meaning-making in the digital age.

The study is structured around key theoretical frameworks, including affect theory, visual culture, and postmodern critique. Drawing on scholars such as Barthes, Derrida, Sontag, and Baudrillard, the analysis highlights how the "Me When I" meme reflects broader cultural trends, including the collapse of coherence, the rise of participatory media, and the emotional resonance of digital artifacts. The thesis argues that the meme’s lo-fi aesthetics, linguistic fragmentation, and absurdist humor serve as tools for navigating the complexities of identity, emotion, and communication in a hyperconnected world.

Ultimately, this research positions the "Me When I" meme as a microcosm of digital culture’s embrace of imperfection, ambiguity, and play. By treating this meme as a serious object of study, the thesis underscores the intellectual value of memes and their capacity to reveal critical insights into the cultural and emotional landscapes of contemporary life.
