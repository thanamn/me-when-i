# Preface

This thesis began with a joke. The image of Apple CEO Tim Cook under the caption “Me When I” was meant to be absurd, a quiet echo of internet nonsense. Yet in the process of trying to understand why it resonated, the joke became serious. This work is the result of that seriousness - an exploration not just of a single meme, but of meaning, communication, fragmentation, absurdity, and emotion in digital life.

What started as a moment of humor evolved into a profound intellectual inquiry. The "Me When I" meme, in its simplicity and absurdity, opened a window into the complexities of digital culture. It revealed how even the most seemingly trivial artifacts can carry deep cultural significance, reflecting the ways we navigate identity, emotion, and meaning in a fragmented and hyperconnected world. This thesis is a testament to the idea that humor and absurdity are not antithetical to intellectual rigor, but rather, essential tools for understanding the nuances of contemporary life.

What follows is a sincere attempt to make sense of nonsense, and to uncover why this cultural form matters. It is both a reflection on the absurdity of digital life and a celebration of its creative potential.
