# Chapter 7: Affective Nonsense — Emotion, Projection, Identity

## 7.1 Introduction to Affective Theory in Digital Culture

Affect theory provides a critical framework for understanding the emotional and embodied dimensions of digital media, including memes like the "Me When I" meme. Affect, as distinct from emotion, refers to pre-conscious, non-cognitive intensities that shape how individuals experience and respond to the world (Massumi 25). In the context of digital culture, affect theory helps illuminate how memes generate emotional resonance and foster participatory engagement, even when their content appears nonsensical or incomplete.

Brian Massumi’s foundational work on affect emphasizes its autonomy from language and representation, highlighting how affect operates as a force that precedes and exceeds conscious interpretation (Massumi 28). This perspective is particularly relevant to the "Me When I" meme, where the low-resolution image of Tim Cook and the incomplete caption evoke an immediate, visceral response that is not entirely reducible to rational analysis. The meme’s absurdity and ambiguity amplify its affective impact, creating a space for viewers to project their own emotions and interpretations onto the content.

Sara Ahmed’s exploration of affective economies further enriches this analysis by examining how emotions circulate and attach to objects, shaping collective experiences and social relations (Ahmed 45). In *The Cultural Politics of Emotion*, Ahmed argues that emotions are not merely personal but are socially mediated, influencing how individuals and communities relate to cultural artifacts (Ahmed 50). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this dynamic, as its participatory nature invites viewers to share, remix, and reinterpret the content, creating affective bonds within digital communities. The meme’s open-endedness allows it to function as a site of collective meaning-making, where affective responses are both individual and communal.

Lauren Berlant’s concept of "cruel optimism" also provides a valuable lens for understanding the affective dimensions of digital media. In *Cruel Optimism*, Berlant explores how attachments to unattainable or contradictory objects of desire shape individuals’ affective experiences (Berlant 21). The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and incongruous imagery, embodies a form of affective tension that resonates with Berlant’s framework. The meme’s absurdity and lack of resolution create a sense of longing and frustration, compelling viewers to engage with the content in search of meaning or closure. This affective dynamic reflects broader trends in digital culture, where fragmented and ephemeral content often elicits complex emotional responses.

The application of affect theory to digital media and memes also highlights the role of aesthetics and form in shaping affective experiences. As Massumi notes, affect is closely tied to the sensory and material qualities of an object, which influence how it is perceived and felt (Massumi 30). The lo-fi aesthetics of the "Me When I" meme, characterized by its pixelation and visual degradation, enhance its affective resonance by creating a sense of estrangement and familiarity. This aesthetic dissonance mirrors the meme’s textual incompletion, amplifying its emotional and cultural impact.

In summary, affect theory provides a robust framework for analyzing the emotional and embodied dimensions of digital media and memes. By drawing on the insights of theorists like Massumi, Ahmed, and Berlant, this section has outlined how affect operates as a force that shapes individual and collective experiences in digital culture. The "Me When I" meme, with its absurdity, ambiguity, and participatory dynamics, exemplifies the affective power of memes to engage audiences on both personal and communal levels. Through its exploration of affect, this chapter aims to uncover the emotional and cultural significance of the "Me When I" meme as a complex artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 7.2 Emotional Projection in Memes

Memes, as cultural artifacts, possess a unique capacity to invite emotional projection, particularly when their content is incomplete or absurd. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in the affective dynamics of digital culture, where viewers engage with memes not merely as passive consumers but as active participants in the creation of meaning. The "Me When I" meme, with its low-resolution image of Tim Cook and its unfinished caption, exemplifies this dynamic by encouraging viewers to project their own emotions, experiences, and interpretations onto the content.

Brian Massumi’s affect theory provides a foundational framework for understanding this process. Massumi emphasizes the pre-cognitive and non-representational nature of affect, describing it as an intensity that precedes conscious interpretation (Massumi 25). In the context of memes, this means that viewers often respond to the visual and textual elements of a meme on an instinctive, emotional level before engaging in rational analysis. The "Me When I" meme’s absurdity and ambiguity amplify this affective response, creating a space for viewers to fill in the gaps with their own emotional and experiential frameworks.

Sara Ahmed’s concept of affective economies further illuminates how memes facilitate emotional projection. Ahmed argues that emotions are not contained within individuals but circulate between subjects and objects, shaping collective experiences and social bonds (Ahmed 45). The "Me When I" meme operates within this affective economy by serving as a blank canvas onto which viewers can project their own feelings and narratives. For instance, one viewer might interpret the meme as a humorous commentary on corporate culture, while another might see it as a reflection of their own feelings of incompletion or absurdity. This multiplicity of interpretations underscores the meme’s participatory nature, as its meaning is co-created through the affective engagements of its audience.

The role of absurdity in facilitating emotional projection is particularly significant. As Sianne Ngai notes in *Our Aesthetic Categories*, absurdity often elicits a paradoxical mix of humor and frustration, creating an affective state that she terms "stuplimity" (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme’s incomplete caption and incongruous imagery exemplify this dynamic by disrupting conventional expectations of coherence and inviting viewers to grapple with its ambiguity. This affective tension compels viewers to invest their own emotions and experiences into the act of interpretation, transforming the meme into a site of personal and collective meaning-making.

Examples from broader meme culture further illustrate this phenomenon. Consider the "Distracted Boyfriend" meme, which features a stock photo of a man turning to look at another woman while his girlfriend looks on disapprovingly. Like the "Me When I" meme, this template invites viewers to project their own narratives and emotions onto the image, using it to express feelings of desire, betrayal, or humor. The meme’s versatility and open-endedness make it a powerful tool for emotional projection, as its meaning is shaped by the specific contexts and experiences of its users.

Similarly, the "Is This a Pigeon?" meme, derived from a still from the anime *The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird*, invites viewers to project their own interpretations onto its absurd premise. The image, which features a man mistaking a butterfly for a pigeon, has been used to comment on everything from misunderstandings to existential crises. Like the "Me When I" meme, its humor and absurdity create a space for affective engagement, allowing viewers to imbue the content with their own emotional and cultural references.

In summary, memes like the "Me When I" meme exemplify the capacity of digital artifacts to invite emotional projection through their incomplete and absurd content. By drawing on the insights of affect theorists like Massumi, Ahmed, and Ngai, this section has demonstrated how memes operate as participatory and affective texts, shaping individual and collective experiences in digital culture. Through their ambiguity and openness, memes not only reflect the emotional landscapes of their audiences but also actively shape the ways in which emotions circulate and attach to cultural objects.

## 7.3 Identity Construction and Meme Participation

The interaction with memes like the "Me When I" meme plays a significant role in the construction and performance of online identities. In digital spaces, where identity is often fluid and performative, memes serve as tools for self-expression, community engagement, and cultural participation. By engaging with memes, users not only consume content but also actively shape their online personas and social affiliations.

Judith Butler’s theory of performativity provides a foundational framework for understanding how identity is constructed through repeated acts and expressions (Butler 25). In the context of digital culture, memes function as performative acts that allow users to articulate aspects of their identity. The "Me When I" meme, with its open-ended caption and absurd imagery, invites users to project their own experiences, emotions, and cultural references onto the content. By sharing, remixing, or commenting on the meme, users participate in a performative process that both reflects and constructs their online identities.

Stuart Hall’s concept of cultural identity further illuminates this dynamic by emphasizing the role of representation in shaping how individuals perceive and present themselves (Hall 223). Memes, as cultural artifacts, operate within systems of representation that mediate identity and social belonging. The "Me When I" meme, for example, allows users to align themselves with specific cultural narratives or communities by interpreting and recontextualizing the meme in ways that resonate with their personal or collective identities. This process of alignment and reinterpretation underscores the participatory nature of meme culture, where identity is co-constructed through shared practices of meaning-making.

The participatory dynamics of meme culture also highlight the relational aspects of identity construction. As danah boyd notes in *It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens*, online identity is often shaped through interactions with others, as users negotiate their self-presentation in response to social feedback (boyd 48). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this relational dynamic by fostering a sense of community and dialogue among its participants. By engaging with the meme, users not only express their own identities but also contribute to the collective identity of the meme’s audience, creating a shared cultural space where meanings and affiliations are continuously negotiated.

The role of humor and absurdity in meme-based identity construction is particularly significant. As Sianne Ngai observes, humor and absurdity often serve as tools for navigating the contradictions and complexities of contemporary life (Ngai 178). The "Me When I" meme’s lo-fi aesthetics and incomplete caption create a space for playful and ironic self-expression, allowing users to explore and perform aspects of their identity in ways that are both subversive and affirming. This interplay between humor and identity is a hallmark of post-ironic digital culture, where memes function as both critiques and celebrations of the social and cultural norms they engage with.

Examples from broader meme culture further illustrate how memes facilitate identity construction. The "This Is Fine" meme, featuring a cartoon dog sitting in a burning room, has been widely used to express feelings of resignation, anxiety, or dark humor. By engaging with this meme, users align themselves with specific affective and cultural narratives, using the meme as a performative tool to articulate their experiences and perspectives. Similarly, the "Woman Yelling at a Cat" meme, which juxtaposes an image of a woman yelling with a photo of a confused cat, has been used to perform identities and relationships through humorous and exaggerated scenarios. These examples demonstrate how memes operate as flexible and participatory texts that enable users to construct and perform their identities in digital spaces.

In summary, interacting with memes like the "Me When I" meme facilitates online identity construction and performance by providing tools for self-expression, cultural participation, and community engagement. Drawing on the insights of theorists like Butler, Hall, and boyd, this section has shown how memes function as performative and relational artifacts that mediate identity in digital culture. Through their humor, absurdity, and participatory dynamics, memes not only reflect the identities of their users but also actively shape the ways in which identity is constructed and performed in the digital age.

## 7.4 The Role of Absurdity and Nonsense in Affect

Absurdity and nonsense are central to the affective power of memes, serving as catalysts for emotional engagement and community bonding in digital culture. The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and incongruous imagery, exemplifies how absurdity disrupts conventional expectations of coherence and meaning, creating a space for affective responses that are both individual and collective. By embracing nonsense, memes invite viewers to engage with content in ways that transcend rational interpretation, fostering emotional connections and shared cultural experiences.

Sianne Ngai’s concept of "stuplimity" provides a critical framework for understanding the affective impact of absurdity in memes. In *Our Aesthetic Categories*, Ngai describes stuplimity as a paradoxical affective state that combines stupefaction and sublimity, elicited by phenomena that are simultaneously overwhelming and ridiculous (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme’s absurdity, manifested in its lo-fi aesthetics and incomplete caption, generates a similar affective response by oscillating between humor and frustration. This dynamic compels viewers to grapple with the meme’s ambiguity, creating an emotional engagement that is both playful and reflective.

The role of absurdity in fostering community bonding is further illuminated by Sara Ahmed’s exploration of affective economies. Ahmed argues that emotions circulate between subjects and objects, shaping collective experiences and social relations (Ahmed 45). In the context of memes, absurdity functions as a shared affective currency that unites viewers through their mutual engagement with nonsensical content. The "Me When I" meme, for example, invites viewers to participate in a collective act of interpretation and humor, creating a sense of belonging and camaraderie within digital communities. By sharing, remixing, and commenting on the meme, users contribute to a communal affective experience that reinforces social bonds and cultural affiliations.

The participatory nature of meme culture also plays a crucial role in amplifying the affective and communal impact of absurdity. As Limor Shifman notes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes are inherently participatory texts that thrive on user engagement and reinterpretation (Shifman 41). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness and absurdity make it particularly conducive to participatory practices, as viewers are encouraged to contribute their own interpretations and variations. This participatory dynamic not only enhances the meme’s affective resonance but also fosters a sense of collective creativity and ownership, strengthening the bonds within its audience.

Examples from broader meme culture further illustrate how absurdity and nonsense generate affective responses and community bonding. The "Surreal Memes" genre, characterized by its bizarre and nonsensical imagery, has gained popularity for its ability to evoke a mix of humor, confusion, and existential reflection. Memes like "Deep-Fried Memes," which feature heavily distorted and exaggerated visuals, similarly leverage absurdity to create a shared affective experience that resonates with audiences across diverse cultural contexts. These examples demonstrate how absurdity functions as a universal language of digital culture, capable of eliciting emotional responses and fostering connections among viewers.

The affective power of absurdity in memes also reflects broader cultural and social dynamics. As Ngai observes, absurdity often serves as a coping mechanism for navigating the contradictions and uncertainties of contemporary life (Ngai 178). In the context of digital culture, where fragmentation and incoherence are pervasive, memes like the "Me When I" meme provide a means of making sense—or embracing the lack of sense—of the world. By engaging with absurdity, viewers not only find humor and solace but also participate in a collective act of meaning-making that reinforces their sense of community and shared experience.

In summary, absurdity and nonsense are integral to the affective and communal dimensions of meme culture. By drawing on the insights of theorists like Ngai, Ahmed, and Shifman, this section has demonstrated how memes like the "Me When I" meme leverage absurdity to generate emotional engagement and foster community bonding. Through their humor, ambiguity, and participatory dynamics, absurd memes not only reflect the complexities of digital culture but also create spaces for connection and collective creativity, positioning themselves as powerful tools for affective and social engagement in the digital age.

## 7.5 The “Me When I” Meme and Emotional Ambiguity

The "Me When I" meme’s ambiguous caption, "Me When I," serves as a powerful catalyst for diverse emotional readings and participatory meaning-making. Its incompleteness invites viewers to engage with the meme in deeply personal and creative ways, transforming it into a site of collective interpretation and emotional resonance. By leaving the caption unfinished, the meme disrupts conventional expectations of textual coherence, creating a space for viewers to project their own experiences, emotions, and cultural references onto the content.

Jacques Derrida’s concept of différance provides a critical framework for understanding how the meme’s ambiguity operates. Différance, which emphasizes the deferral and instability of meaning in language, is particularly relevant to the "Me When I" meme’s incomplete caption (Derrida 25). The absence of a complete statement compels viewers to fill in the gaps, creating a participatory dynamic that aligns with Derrida’s notion of textual openness. This openness not only democratizes the process of meaning-making but also amplifies the meme’s emotional and cultural impact, as each viewer’s interpretation adds a new layer of meaning to the artifact.

The participatory nature of the meme’s ambiguity is further illuminated by Roland Barthes’s concept of the "writerly text." In *S/Z*, Barthes contrasts the "readerly text," which imposes a fixed meaning on the reader, with the "writerly text," which invites readers to become co-creators of meaning (Barthes 4). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies the writerly text by encouraging viewers to complete the caption with their own narratives, emotions, or cultural references. This participatory dynamic transforms the meme into a collaborative artifact, where meaning is constantly remade and reimagined through the contributions of its audience.

The emotional ambiguity of the meme also aligns with Sara Ahmed’s exploration of affective economies. Ahmed argues that emotions circulate between subjects and objects, shaping collective experiences and social relations (Ahmed 45). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness allows it to function as an affective node, where diverse emotional responses converge and interact. For instance, one viewer might interpret the meme as a humorous commentary on the absurdities of corporate culture, while another might see it as a reflection of their own feelings of incompletion or existential uncertainty. This multiplicity of interpretations underscores the meme’s capacity to resonate with a wide range of emotional and cultural contexts, making it a versatile and impactful artifact of digital culture.

Examples from broader meme culture further illustrate how ambiguity fosters participatory meaning-making. The "One Does Not Simply" meme, derived from a still of Boromir in *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, features an open-ended caption format that invites users to complete the phrase with their own humorous or insightful takes. Similarly, the "Expanding Brain" meme, which uses a series of images to depict increasingly abstract or absurd ideas, relies on its ambiguous structure to encourage creative reinterpretation. Like the "Me When I" meme, these examples demonstrate how ambiguity serves as a powerful tool for engaging audiences and fostering collective creativity.

The affective and participatory dimensions of the "Me When I" meme also reflect broader trends in post-ironic digital culture. As Sianne Ngai observes, the interplay between humor and frustration often characterizes the affective responses elicited by ambiguous or nonsensical content (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme’s incomplete caption and incongruous imagery exemplify this dynamic by creating a sense of playful tension that invites viewers to grapple with its meaning. This affective engagement not only enhances the meme’s cultural resonance but also reinforces its role as a site of collective meaning-making and emotional expression.

In summary, the "Me When I" meme’s ambiguous caption exemplifies the power of incompleteness to foster diverse emotional readings and participatory meaning-making. By drawing on the insights of theorists like Derrida, Barthes, and Ahmed, this section has demonstrated how the meme’s openness transforms it into a collaborative and affective artifact of digital culture. Through its ambiguity, the meme not only reflects the complexities of contemporary life but also creates a space for connection, creativity, and shared emotional experiences in the digital age.

## 7.6 Chapter Summary

The "Me When I" meme exemplifies the profound cultural impact of digital artifacts that leverage affect theory, emotional projection, identity construction, and absurdity. By engaging viewers on both personal and communal levels, the meme transcends its seemingly simple format to become a complex and participatory artifact of digital culture.

Affect theory provides a lens for understanding the meme’s ability to elicit visceral, pre-cognitive responses. As theorists like Massumi and Ahmed have shown, affect operates as a force that shapes individual and collective experiences. The "Me When I" meme’s lo-fi aesthetics and incomplete caption amplify its affective resonance, creating a space for viewers to project their own emotions and interpretations onto the content. This dynamic not only enhances the meme’s emotional impact but also fosters a sense of connection and shared experience among its audience.

Emotional projection further underscores the participatory nature of the meme. By inviting viewers to fill in the gaps left by its ambiguous caption, the meme becomes a collaborative text that reflects the diverse emotional landscapes of its audience. This openness aligns with Barthes’s concept of the "writerly text," transforming the meme into a site of collective meaning-making and cultural expression.

The role of identity construction in meme culture is equally significant. As Butler and Hall have argued, identity is performative and relational, shaped through acts of representation and social interaction. The "Me When I" meme allows users to explore and perform aspects of their identity through humor, absurdity, and cultural references. By engaging with the meme, users not only express their own identities but also contribute to the collective identity of the meme’s community.

Finally, the absurdity of the "Me When I" meme serves as both a critique and a celebration of digital culture. As Ngai and Shifman have noted, absurdity functions as a powerful tool for navigating the contradictions and uncertainties of contemporary life. The meme’s nonsensical elements create a space for playful and reflective engagement, fostering emotional connections and community bonding.

In summary, the "Me When I" meme’s cultural impact lies in its ability to integrate affect theory, emotional projection, identity construction, and absurdity into a cohesive and participatory experience. By doing so, it not only reflects the complexities of digital culture but also creates a space for connection, creativity, and shared meaning in the digital age.
