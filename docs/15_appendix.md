### Meme Metadata

- **Image Subject**: Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc.
- **Text Overlay**: "Me When I" (incomplete caption)
- **Image Quality**: Low-resolution, compressed digital image
- **Visual Characteristics**: Grainy texture, muted colors, amateur aesthetic
- **Format**: Digital meme (image with text overlay)
- **Creator**: Author of this thesis (original creation)
- **Distribution**: Private sharing among friends via messaging apps and Instagram
- **Cultural Context**: Post-ironic internet humor, incomplete meme format
- **Date Range**: Created during thesis research period (2024-2025)

### Technical Specifications

- **File Type**: JPEG/PNG (varies by platform)
- **Typical Resolution**: 480x480 to 720x720 pixels (varies)
- **Color Depth**: 24-bit RGB
- **Compression**: High (contributing to "lo-fi" aesthetic)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Approximately 1:1 (square format, optimized for social media)

### Source and Circulation

- **Original Source**: Created by thesis author
- **Primary Distribution**: 
  - Friends' private messaging apps
  - Instagram direct messages/stories
  - Small friend group circulation
- **Circulation Pattern**: Limited, intimate sharing within personal network
- **Usage Context**: Private humor, friend group communication, personal expression
- **Variations**: None (original creation for thesis analysis)

## A.2 Theoretical Framework Summary

### Key Theoretical Concepts Applied

1. **Post-Ironic Sensibility** (Sontag, Ngai)
   - Deliberate ambiguity between sincerity and irony
   - Emotional engagement despite apparent meaninglessness

2. **Digital Semiotics** (Barthes, Derrida)
   - Image-text relationship analysis
   - Deconstruction of incomplete linguistic structures

3. **Poor Image Aesthetics** (Steyerl)
   - Low-resolution as democratizing force
   - Circulation value over image quality

4. **Convergence Culture** (Jenkins)
   - Participatory media engagement
   - Collective meaning-making processes

## A.3 Methodological Notes

### Research Approach

This thesis employs a **multidisciplinary cultural analysis** combining:

- **Semiotic Analysis**: Examination of sign-signifier relationships
- **Linguistic Deconstruction**: Analysis of incomplete textual elements  
- **Visual Culture Studies**: Contextualization within digital aesthetics
- **Affect Theory**: Investigation of emotional responses to ambiguity

### Limitations

- **Sample Size**: Single meme created by researcher (autoethnographic approach)
- **Circulation Scope**: Limited to personal friend network, not viral distribution
- **Cultural Context**: Analysis primarily within author's immediate social circle
- **Temporal Specificity**: Created specifically for thesis research
- **Researcher Positionality**: Author as both creator and analyst of cultural artifact

## A.4 Additional Considerations

### Ethical Considerations

- **Autoethnographic Method**: Researcher analyzing own cultural creation
- **Privacy**: Friends' responses kept anonymous and confidential
- **Consent**: Friend group aware of academic analysis context
- **Self-Reflexivity**: Author acknowledges dual role as creator and critic

### Methodological Significance

The fact that this meme was created by the thesis author rather than found "in the wild" adds several important dimensions to the analysis:

- **Intentionality**: The incompleteness was deliberately crafted, not accidental
- **Reception Context**: Analysis includes firsthand observation of friends' reactions
- **Creative Process**: Author can reflect on the motivations behind the aesthetic choices
- **Intimate Circulation**: The meme's meaning emerges within a specific social network
- **Autoethnographic Value**: Provides insight into personal/collective meaning-making processes

### Future Research Directions

- **Comparative Meme Analysis**: Similar incomplete meme formats
- **Platform-Specific Studies**: How different platforms affect meme reception
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Tracking meme evolution over time
- **Cross-Cultural Studies**: Reception in non-English speaking communities
