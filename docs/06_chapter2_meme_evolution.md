# Chapter 2: From Humor to Incompletion — Meme Evolution & the Post-Ironic Turn

## 2.1 Introduction to Meme Evolution

The concept of the meme, as introduced by Richard Dawkins in his seminal work *The Selfish Gene* (1976), provides a framework for understanding cultural transmission and evolution. Dawkins defines memes as units of cultural information—ideas, behaviors, or styles—that spread from person to person within a culture, analogous to the way genes propagate biological information. Memes, according to Dawkins, are subject to variation, competition, and selection, making them a cornerstone for understanding how cultural phenomena evolve over time (Dawkins 192). While Dawkins’ original concept was broad, encompassing everything from melodies to architectural styles, the advent of the internet has given rise to a specific subset of memes: internet memes.

Limor Shifman, a leading scholar in internet meme studies, builds on Dawkins’ foundational ideas to explore how memes function in the digital age. In her book *Memes in Digital Culture* (2014), Shifman defines internet memes as "(a) a group of digital items sharing common characteristics of content, form, and/or stance, which (b) were created with awareness of each other, and (c) were circulated, imitated, and/or transformed via the internet by many users" (Shifman 41). This definition highlights the participatory and iterative nature of internet memes, distinguishing them from their pre-digital counterparts. Unlike traditional cultural artifacts, which often rely on centralized production and dissemination, internet memes thrive in decentralized, user-driven environments. Platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram serve as fertile grounds for the creation, adaptation, and dissemination of memes, enabling them to evolve at an unprecedented pace.

The evolution of memes into internet memes marks a significant shift in how cultural information is transmitted and transformed. Early internet memes, such as "Dancing Baby" or "All Your Base Are Belong to Us," were often isolated phenomena, shared via email chains or niche forums. These early memes were characterized by their novelty and humor, serving as digital curiosities that reflected the nascent culture of the internet. However, as the internet became more accessible and participatory, memes began to evolve into more complex and interconnected forms. The rise of social media platforms in the mid-2000s further accelerated this evolution, providing users with the tools to create, share, and remix content on a global scale.

One of the defining features of internet memes is their capacity for rapid adaptation and transformation. Shifman notes that memes often function as "cultural templates," providing a framework that users can modify to suit their own purposes (Shifman 56). This adaptability is evident in meme formats like "Distracted Boyfriend" or "Woman Yelling at a Cat," which have been endlessly reinterpreted to comment on a wide range of topics, from personal relationships to political discourse. The participatory nature of internet memes aligns with Henry Jenkins’ concept of "convergence culture," which describes how media consumers become active participants in the creation and circulation of content (Jenkins 3). In this context, memes serve as both cultural artifacts and tools for social commentary, reflecting the values, anxieties, and humor of the communities that create and share them.

The transition from traditional memes to internet memes also underscores the role of technology in shaping cultural transmission. Digital platforms not only facilitate the rapid spread of memes but also influence their form and content. For example, the character limits of Twitter encourage brevity and wit, while the visual nature of Instagram prioritizes image-based memes. These technological affordances shape the way memes are created and consumed, highlighting the interplay between cultural and technological evolution. As Shifman observes, "the internet has transformed memes from static units of culture into dynamic, participatory phenomena" (Shifman 78).

Moreover, the evolution of internet memes reflects broader cultural shifts toward interactivity, fragmentation, and irony. Memes often rely on shared cultural knowledge and implicit understanding, making them accessible to those "in the know" while excluding outsiders. This dynamic fosters a sense of community among meme creators and consumers, while also reinforcing cultural boundaries. The rise of post-ironic and absurdist memes, such as the "Me When I" meme, further illustrates how internet culture has embraced ambiguity and incompletion as forms of expression. These trends align with Fredric Jameson’s analysis of postmodernism, which emphasizes the fragmentation and decentralization of cultural production in late capitalist society (Jameson 25).

In summary, the concept of the meme has evolved significantly since Dawkins first introduced it as a unit of cultural transmission. Internet memes, as explored by Shifman and other scholars, represent a dynamic and participatory form of cultural expression that reflects the technological and social transformations of the digital age. By examining the evolution of memes, we can gain valuable insights into how culture is created, shared, and transformed in an increasingly interconnected world. This chapter will build on these foundational ideas to explore how the "Me When I" meme fits within the broader history of internet humor and participatory media, highlighting its significance as a post-ironic artifact of digital culture.

## 2.2 Early Internet Humor: Rage Comics, Advice Animals

The early days of internet memes were marked by formats that prioritized clarity, structure, and a consistent humor logic. Among the most iconic of these early meme formats were Rage Comics, Advice Animals, and Demotivators, each of which played a significant role in shaping the landscape of internet humor.

Rage Comics, which emerged in the late 2000s, were a series of webcomic-style panels that used a set of recurring characters, or "rage faces," to depict everyday frustrations and humorous scenarios. These comics were often created using simple tools like MS Paint or online generators, making them accessible to a wide audience. The humor in Rage Comics relied heavily on their narrative structure: a setup, a conflict, and a punchline, often delivered through exaggerated facial expressions and minimal text. As Limor Shifman notes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, Rage Comics exemplify the participatory nature of internet memes, as users could easily create and share their own versions, contributing to a collective repository of humor (Shifman 45). The consistent use of recognizable characters like "Trollface" or "Forever Alone" further reinforced their appeal, creating a shared visual language that resonated with internet users.

Similarly, Advice Animals, which gained popularity around the same time, were image macros featuring a central character or animal paired with text that followed a specific formula. Examples include "Socially Awkward Penguin," "Success Kid," and "Bad Luck Brian." These memes typically juxtaposed an image with a two-line caption: the top line setting up a situation and the bottom line delivering the punchline. The humor in Advice Animals was direct and often relatable, drawing on universal experiences or exaggerated stereotypes. According to Whitney Phillips in her book *This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things*, the simplicity and versatility of Advice Animals made them highly shareable, as users could easily adapt the format to suit their own comedic or social commentary needs (Phillips 67). The formulaic nature of these memes ensured that their meaning was clear and their humor accessible, even to those encountering them for the first time.

Demotivators, a precursor to many internet memes, originated as parodies of motivational posters. These image macros featured a striking visual, a bold title, and a sarcastic or ironic caption, often critiquing workplace culture or societal norms. Unlike Rage Comics and Advice Animals, which thrived on relatability and participatory creation, Demotivators were more static, serving as standalone pieces of humor. However, their influence on later meme formats is undeniable, as they introduced the concept of combining text and image to create a humorous or thought-provoking message. Shifman highlights that Demotivators represent an early example of how internet users repurposed traditional media formats for comedic effect, laying the groundwork for the more dynamic and participatory memes that would follow (Shifman 52).

What unites these early meme formats is their adherence to a clear and consistent logic. The humor was self-contained, with each meme delivering a complete idea or joke within its format. This contrasts sharply with the fragmented and often ambiguous nature of post-ironic memes, which will be explored in subsequent sections. The structured nature of early memes made them accessible to a broad audience, fostering a sense of community among creators and consumers. As Shifman observes, "the early internet meme culture was characterized by its emphasis on clarity and shared understanding, which allowed for widespread participation and enjoyment" (Shifman 60).

In summary, Rage Comics, Advice Animals, and Demotivators represent a foundational era in internet meme culture, defined by their structured humor and participatory nature. These formats not only provided a template for future memes but also reflected the early internet's emphasis on relatability, creativity, and community. By examining these early meme formats, we can better understand the evolution of internet humor and its shift toward the irony and incompletion that characterize contemporary memes.

## 2.3 The Rise of Irony and Absurdism

The evolution of internet memes from structured, coherent humor to irony, meta-irony, and absurdism marks a significant cultural shift in digital expression. This transition reflects broader societal trends, including the fragmentation of meaning, the rise of postmodern sensibilities, and the increasing saturation of digital media. Irony and absurdism have become defining characteristics of contemporary meme culture, challenging traditional notions of humor and communication.

Irony, as a rhetorical device, has long been a staple of humor and cultural critique. However, the internet has amplified its use, transforming it into a dominant mode of expression. Early ironic memes often subverted expectations by juxtaposing incongruous elements or presenting exaggerated versions of cultural tropes. As Whitney Phillips observes in *This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things*, irony in internet culture often serves as a coping mechanism, allowing users to navigate the overwhelming and often absurd nature of digital life (Phillips 89). This ironic detachment creates a sense of shared understanding among those "in the know," while simultaneously alienating outsiders.

The rise of meta-irony, which takes irony to a self-referential and often paradoxical level, further complicates the landscape of internet humor. Meta-ironic memes frequently parody the conventions of traditional memes, using their own absurdity as a form of critique. For example, the "Deep-Fried Memes" trend involves intentionally degrading the quality of an image to the point of absurdity, often accompanied by nonsensical text. This deliberate embrace of lo-fi aesthetics and incomprehensibility reflects a broader cultural shift toward what Sianne Ngai terms "stuplimity." In her book *Ugly Feelings*, Ngai describes stuplimity as a combination of astonishment and boredom, evoked by overwhelming or nonsensical stimuli (Ngai 271). Meta-ironic memes embody this concept, as their absurdity both captivates and frustrates the viewer, challenging traditional expectations of humor and coherence.

Absurdist memes, which often eschew any semblance of logic or meaning, represent the culmination of this trend. These memes thrive on their incomprehensibility, using randomness and surrealism to provoke laughter or confusion. Examples include the "Surreal Memes" genre, which features bizarre imagery and cryptic captions, and the "Me When I" meme, which intentionally leaves its joke unfinished. The humor in these memes lies not in their content but in their defiance of conventional humor structures. As Fredric Jameson notes in his analysis of postmodernism, the fragmentation and decentralization of cultural production in late capitalist society have led to a proliferation of forms that resist traditional narrative and meaning (Jameson 25). Absurdist memes exemplify this phenomenon, reflecting a cultural landscape in which coherence is no longer a prerequisite for engagement.

The shift toward irony, meta-irony, and absurdism in meme culture can also be understood as a response to the saturation of digital media. In an environment where content is constantly created, shared, and remixed, the boundaries between originality and imitation become increasingly blurred. This saturation fosters a sense of detachment and cynicism, as users become desensitized to traditional forms of humor and meaning. Irony and absurdism offer a way to navigate this landscape, providing a means of expression that acknowledges and embraces the chaos of digital life.

Moreover, the rise of these forms of humor reflects broader cultural anxieties about authenticity and sincerity. In a digital age characterized by performativity and self-presentation, irony serves as a protective mechanism, allowing users to engage with content while maintaining a sense of detachment. As Phillips argues, the ironic stance often functions as a shield against vulnerability, enabling users to participate in digital culture without fully committing to its norms and expectations (Phillips 92). This dynamic is particularly evident in meta-ironic and absurdist memes, which use their own absurdity to critique the very culture that produces them.

The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this shift toward irony and absurdism. By presenting an incomplete phrase and a low-res image of Tim Cook, the meme invites viewers to project their own interpretations onto it, while simultaneously resisting any definitive meaning. This intentional incompletion aligns with Ngai’s concept of stuplimity, as the meme’s ambiguity both engages and frustrates the viewer. It also reflects Jameson’s analysis of postmodernism, as the meme’s fragmented and decentralized nature mirrors the broader cultural conditions of late capitalism.

In summary, the rise of irony, meta-irony, and absurdism in meme culture represents a significant departure from the structured humor of earlier formats. These forms of expression challenge traditional notions of meaning and coherence, reflecting the complexities and contradictions of digital life. By embracing ambiguity and incompletion, memes like "Me When I" offer a lens through which to explore the cultural and aesthetic dynamics of the internet age.

## 2.4 The Logic of Incompletion

The embrace of incompletion in meme culture represents a radical departure from the structured humor of earlier formats. This shift is exemplified by memes that feature unfinished captions, strange punchlines, and awkward formatting, challenging traditional expectations of coherence and resolution. The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete phrase and low-res image of Tim Cook, serves as a paradigmatic example of this trend, encapsulating the aesthetic and cultural logic of incompletion.

Incompletion as a deliberate aesthetic choice can be understood through the lens of postmodernism, which emphasizes fragmentation, ambiguity, and the rejection of grand narratives. Fredric Jameson’s analysis of postmodern culture highlights the ways in which late capitalism has produced a fragmented and decentralized cultural landscape, where meaning is often elusive or deferred (Jameson 25). Memes like "Me When I" reflect this condition, as their humor lies not in delivering a clear punchline but in subverting the very expectation of one. The unfinished caption invites viewers to project their own interpretations onto the meme, creating a participatory dynamic that aligns with the decentralized nature of internet culture.

The logic of incompletion also resonates with Roland Barthes’ concept of the "writerly text," which encourages active interpretation and engagement from the reader. In *S/Z*, Barthes contrasts the "readerly text," which presents a fixed and consumable meaning, with the "writerly text," which demands that the reader become a co-creator of meaning (Barthes 4). The "Me When I" meme operates as a writerly text, as its lack of resolution compels viewers to fill in the gaps, transforming the act of interpretation into a form of participation. This open-endedness not only fosters creativity but also reflects the participatory ethos of meme culture, where users are both consumers and creators of content.

The aesthetic of incompletion is further reinforced by the lo-fi and awkward formatting often associated with such memes. The low resolution of the "Me When I" image, combined with its minimalist caption, creates a sense of intentional crudeness that aligns with the broader trend of lo-fi aesthetics in digital culture. As Sianne Ngai observes in *Our Aesthetic Categories*, the "zany," "cute," and "interesting" have emerged as dominant aesthetic categories in late capitalism, reflecting the affective and performative dimensions of contemporary culture (Ngai 7). The "Me When I" meme embodies the "zany" through its absurdity and incompletion, engaging viewers in a playful yet disorienting encounter with its content.

The humor of incomplete memes often relies on their ability to disrupt conventional expectations of narrative and meaning. By presenting an unfinished thought or an awkwardly formatted image, these memes create a sense of cognitive dissonance that can be both amusing and thought-provoking. This dynamic aligns with Sianne Ngai’s concept of "stuplimity," which describes the simultaneous feelings of astonishment and boredom evoked by overwhelming or nonsensical stimuli (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme, for instance, elicits a mix of confusion and amusement, as its lack of resolution forces viewers to confront the absurdity of its form and content.

The rise of incomplete memes also reflects broader cultural anxieties about attention and meaning in the digital age. In an environment characterized by information overload and rapid content consumption, the fragmented and ambiguous nature of such memes mirrors the fragmented nature of digital experience. As Jonathan Crary argues in *24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep*, the relentless pace of digital life has eroded traditional notions of attention and focus, leading to a culture of distraction and fragmentation (Crary 13). Incomplete memes, with their abrupt and unresolved nature, resonate with this cultural condition, offering a form of humor that is both reflective of and responsive to the dynamics of digital life.

The "Me When I" meme, in particular, exemplifies the ways in which incompletion can function as a form of social and cultural commentary. By refusing to provide a clear punchline or resolution, the meme subverts traditional humor structures, inviting viewers to engage with its ambiguity on their own terms. This open-endedness not only challenges conventional notions of humor but also reflects the participatory and iterative nature of meme culture, where meaning is constantly negotiated and redefined by its users.

In summary, the logic of incompletion in meme culture represents a significant shift in the aesthetics and dynamics of digital humor. Memes like "Me When I" challenge traditional expectations of coherence and resolution, embracing ambiguity and fragmentation as forms of expression. By examining the cultural and theoretical underpinnings of this trend, we can gain a deeper understanding of how memes function as both artifacts and agents of contemporary digital culture.

## 2.5 Memes as Post-Textual Artifacts

The evolution of memes into lo-fi, image-dominant artifacts marks a significant shift in their aesthetic and communicative functions. This transformation reflects broader cultural and technological trends, including the collapse of textual narrative, the prioritization of visual syntax, and the effects of digital compression. Memes have increasingly become post-textual objects, where meaning is conveyed through degraded visuals and fragmented aesthetics rather than coherent textual narratives.

Susan Sontag’s reflections on the power of the image in *On Photography* provide a useful framework for understanding this shift. Sontag argues that images possess an immediacy and emotional resonance that text often lacks, making them uniquely suited to the demands of a visually saturated culture (Sontag 17). Memes, as visual artifacts, capitalize on this immediacy, using their lo-fi aesthetics and compressed formats to create a sense of rawness and authenticity. The "Me When I" meme, with its low-resolution image of Tim Cook and minimalist caption, exemplifies this trend, relying on its visual impact rather than textual elaboration to engage viewers.

The aesthetic collapse evident in many contemporary memes can also be understood through the lens of Alexander Galloway’s analysis of digital media. In *The Interface Effect*, Galloway explores how digital interfaces mediate and transform cultural artifacts, often privileging speed and accessibility over fidelity and coherence (Galloway 32). Memes, as products of digital interfaces, embody this dynamic, as their lo-fi aesthetics and compressed formats reflect the technological constraints and affordances of platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. The degradation of image quality, often intentional, becomes a stylistic choice that aligns with the broader cultural embrace of imperfection and incompletion.

The lo-fi aesthetic of memes also resonates with the principles of Glitch Studies, which celebrate the creative potential of errors, distortions, and imperfections in digital media. Rosa Menkman, a leading figure in Glitch Studies, argues that glitches reveal the underlying structures and processes of digital systems, challenging conventional notions of perfection and functionality (Menkman 29). Memes that embrace lo-fi aesthetics, such as "Deep-Fried Memes" or the "Me When I" meme, similarly disrupt traditional aesthetic norms, using their degraded visuals to critique and subvert the polished imagery often associated with digital culture. This aesthetic of collapse not only reflects the technological conditions of meme production but also serves as a form of cultural commentary, highlighting the tensions between authenticity and artifice in the digital age.

The lack of textual narrative in many contemporary memes further underscores their post-textual nature. Unlike earlier meme formats, which often relied on captions or punchlines to convey humor or meaning, lo-fi memes prioritize visual syntax and implicit understanding. The "Me When I" meme, for instance, eschews a complete textual narrative, instead inviting viewers to interpret its meaning through the interplay of image and caption. This reliance on visual syntax aligns with Sontag’s observation that images can function as "a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing" (Sontag 23). By foregrounding the visual, memes challenge viewers to engage with their content on a more intuitive and affective level, fostering a form of communication that is both immediate and open-ended.

The compression and degradation of memes also reflect the economic and technological conditions of their circulation. As Jonathan Sterne notes in *MP3: The Meaning of a Format*, compression technologies prioritize efficiency and portability over fidelity, shaping the way cultural artifacts are produced and consumed (Sterne 19). Memes, as highly compressed digital objects, embody this logic, as their degraded visuals and minimal file sizes facilitate rapid sharing and remixing across platforms. This compression not only affects their aesthetic qualities but also influences their cultural significance, as the act of sharing and remixing becomes integral to their meaning and value.

In summary, the transformation of memes into lo-fi, image-dominant artifacts reflects a broader cultural and technological shift toward post-textuality. By embracing aesthetic collapse, compression, and visual syntax, memes like "Me When I" challenge traditional notions of narrative and coherence, offering a new mode of communication that is both fragmented and participatory. Through the lenses of Sontag, Galloway, and Glitch Studies, we can better understand how memes function as both products and critiques of the digital age.

## 2.6 Chapter Summary

This chapter has traced the evolution of memes from their early structured formats to the fragmented, ironic, and incomplete forms that dominate contemporary digital culture. Beginning with foundational formats like Rage Comics, Advice Animals, and Demotivators, we explored how early memes relied on clarity, structure, and participatory humor to foster a sense of community and shared understanding. These formats provided a template for the participatory and iterative nature of internet memes, setting the stage for their subsequent evolution.

The rise of irony and absurdism marked a significant departure from the structured humor of earlier memes. Through the lens of meta-irony and absurdist aesthetics, we examined how memes began to subvert traditional humor conventions, embracing randomness, incomprehensibility, and self-referential critique. Drawing on theoretical insights from Sianne Ngai and Fredric Jameson, we contextualized this shift within broader cultural and technological trends, highlighting the ways in which memes reflect and respond to the complexities of digital life.

The logic of incompletion emerged as a defining characteristic of contemporary memes, exemplified by the "Me When I" meme. By presenting unfinished captions, strange punchlines, and awkward formatting, these memes challenge traditional expectations of coherence and resolution. Theoretical frameworks from Roland Barthes and Sianne Ngai illuminated how incompletion fosters active interpretation and participatory engagement, aligning with the decentralized and iterative ethos of meme culture.

Finally, we reflected on the transformation of memes into lo-fi, image-dominant artifacts, emphasizing their post-textual nature and aesthetic collapse. Drawing on Susan Sontag, Alexander Galloway, and Glitch Studies, we analyzed how memes use degraded visuals and fragmented aesthetics to critique and subvert digital culture, offering a new mode of communication that is both fragmented and participatory.

Together, these explorations provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the "Me When I" meme as a post-ironic artifact of digital culture. By situating this meme within the broader history and aesthetics of internet humor, we are now prepared to analyze its significance as a cultural expression that embodies the tensions, contradictions, and possibilities of the digital age.
