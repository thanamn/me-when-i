# Chapter 6: Theoretical Lenses — Applying Critical Theory to the Meme

## 6.1 Introduction to Critical Theories Applied

The "Me When I" meme, with its low-resolution image of Tim Cook and incomplete caption, serves as a rich artifact for critical analysis through the lens of major theoretical frameworks. This section introduces the critical theorists whose ideas will be applied in this chapter—Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Sianne Ngai, Walter Benjamin, and Susan Sontag—and briefly outlines their relevance to the meme’s analysis.

Roland Barthes’s work on semiotics and mythologies provides a foundational framework for understanding the meme’s dual layers of meaning. In *Mythologies*, Barthes explores how cultural artifacts operate as sign systems, where the denotative meaning of an image or text is overlaid with connotative, culturally constructed meanings (Barthes 114). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies this dynamic, as the image of Tim Cook and the incomplete caption function as signs that invite multiple interpretations. Barthes’s concept of myth, which he defines as a second-order semiological system, will be used to unpack how the meme constructs and communicates cultural narratives about corporate personhood, digital culture, and participatory media.

Jacques Derrida’s theory of deconstruction offers another critical lens, particularly in analyzing the meme’s incomplete caption and its implications for meaning-making. Derrida’s concept of différance, which emphasizes the deferral and instability of meaning in language, is particularly relevant to the "Me When I" meme’s fragmented text. The absence of a complete statement invites viewers to fill in the gaps, creating a participatory dynamic that aligns with Derrida’s notion of textual openness (Derrida 25). By applying deconstruction, this chapter will explore how the meme’s incompletion disrupts traditional expectations of coherence and meaning, reflecting broader trends in postmodern and digital culture.

Sianne Ngai’s concept of “stuplimity,” introduced in *Ugly Feelings* and further developed in *Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting*, provides a framework for understanding the affective response elicited by the meme. Stuplimity, a blend of stupefaction and sublimity, describes the paradoxical emotional state evoked by absurd or overwhelming phenomena (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme’s absurdity—manifested in its low-resolution image, incomplete caption, and incongruous pairing of text and image—elicits a mix of humor, confusion, and critical reflection. Ngai’s work will be used to analyze how the meme’s aesthetic and emotional impact engages audiences in a uniquely post-ironic way.

Walter Benjamin’s seminal essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” offers critical insights into the meme’s status as a reproducible digital artifact. Benjamin’s concept of “aura,” which he defines as the unique presence of an artwork in time and space, is challenged by the mass reproduction and circulation of digital media (Benjamin 221). The "Me When I" meme, as a product of digital culture, exemplifies this loss of aura while simultaneously gaining new forms of cultural significance through its participatory and iterative nature. Benjamin’s ideas will be applied to explore how the meme’s reproducibility shapes its meaning and reception in the context of digital networks.

Finally, Susan Sontag’s theories on photography and image interpretation, as articulated in *On Photography*, provide a lens for analyzing the meme’s visual impact and ethical dimensions. Sontag’s exploration of the power dynamics inherent in photographic representation is particularly relevant to the "Me When I" meme, which juxtaposes the authoritative image of a corporate figure with the subversive humor of internet culture (Sontag 5). Her insights into the ethics of viewing and interpreting images will be used to examine how the meme navigates the tension between critique and complicity in its portrayal of Tim Cook.

Together, these theorists provide a multi-faceted framework for analyzing the "Me When I" meme. Barthes’s semiotics, Derrida’s deconstruction, Ngai’s affect theory, Benjamin’s critique of reproducibility, and Sontag’s insights into photography and ethics will be applied to uncover the meme’s layered meanings and cultural significance. By engaging with these critical perspectives, this chapter aims to demonstrate how the "Me When I" meme operates as a complex artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.2 Barthes and Mythologies: Myth and Signification

Roland Barthes’s theory of myth and signification, as articulated in *Mythologies*, provides a powerful framework for analyzing the "Me When I" meme. Barthes defines myth as a second-order semiological system, where the denotative meaning of a sign is overlaid with connotative, culturally constructed meanings (Barthes 114). In the context of the "Me When I" meme, both the image of Tim Cook and the incomplete caption function as signs that operate on multiple levels of meaning, constructing and deconstructing cultural myths in the process.

At the denotative level, the image of Tim Cook is a straightforward representation of a corporate figure, specifically the CEO of Apple. However, at the connotative level, this image becomes a symbol of corporate authority, technological innovation, and the polished branding associated with Apple as a global entity. The incomplete caption, “Me When I,” further complicates this sign system by introducing an open-ended textual element that invites viewers to project their own interpretations. Together, the image and text create a dynamic interplay between denotation and connotation, where the meme’s meaning is both constructed and deferred.

Barthes’s concept of myth is particularly relevant to understanding how the "Me When I" meme engages with cultural narratives about corporate personhood and digital culture. The polished image of Tim Cook, when juxtaposed with the lo-fi aesthetics of the meme, subverts the myth of corporate infallibility. In *Mythologies*, Barthes argues that myths serve to naturalize cultural ideologies, making them appear self-evident and universal (Barthes 142). The "Me When I" meme disrupts this process by exposing the constructed nature of corporate branding. The pixelation and visual degradation of Tim Cook’s image, combined with the absurdity of the incomplete caption, challenge the seamless and authoritative image typically associated with corporate leaders. In doing so, the meme deconstructs the myth of the CEO as an unassailable figure of power and control, revealing the human vulnerability and absurdity underlying this cultural construct.

The incomplete caption, “Me When I,” also plays a crucial role in the meme’s engagement with myth and signification. By leaving the statement unfinished, the meme creates a sense of incompletion and ambiguity that resists fixed meanings. This aligns with Barthes’s notion of the “writerly text,” which invites readers to become co-creators of meaning rather than passive consumers (Barthes 4). The open-ended nature of the caption encourages viewers to fill in the gaps with their own experiences, emotions, or cultural references, transforming the meme into a participatory artifact. This participatory dynamic not only democratizes the process of meaning-making but also subverts the traditional hierarchies of authorship and authority embedded in corporate and media narratives.

Moreover, the "Me When I" meme can be seen as a critique of the myths surrounding digital culture and participatory media. While digital platforms often celebrate the democratization of content creation and the empowerment of individual voices, the meme’s lo-fi aesthetics and absurd humor highlight the limitations and contradictions of these narratives. The degraded image of Tim Cook, paired with the incomplete caption, serves as a visual and textual metaphor for the fragmented and often incoherent nature of digital communication. In this sense, the meme both constructs and deconstructs the myth of digital culture as a space of limitless creativity and connection, exposing the tensions and ambiguities that define the participatory ethos of the internet.

Barthes’s theory also sheds light on the affective dimensions of the "Me When I" meme. The juxtaposition of Tim Cook’s authoritative image with the absurdity of the incomplete caption creates a sense of irony and humor that engages viewers on an emotional level. This affective response, while seemingly trivial, plays a crucial role in the meme’s cultural resonance. As Barthes notes, myths operate not only through intellectual persuasion but also through emotional appeal, shaping how individuals perceive and relate to cultural artifacts (Barthes 149). The "Me When I" meme leverages this dynamic by using humor and absurdity to critique and reframe cultural myths, making its message both accessible and impactful.

In summary, Roland Barthes’s theory of myth and signification provides a nuanced framework for analyzing the "Me When I" meme. By deconstructing the myths of corporate personhood, digital culture, and participatory media, the meme reveals the constructed nature of these narratives and invites viewers to engage in the process of meaning-making. Through its interplay of image and text, denotation and connotation, and humor and critique, the "Me When I" meme exemplifies the power of digital artifacts to challenge and reimagine cultural myths in the context of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.3 Derrida and Deconstruction: Incompletion and Deferral of Meaning

Jacques Derrida’s theory of deconstruction provides a compelling lens through which to analyze the "Me When I" meme, particularly its incomplete caption and the ways in which it defers meaning and resists closure. Central to Derrida’s philosophy is the concept of différance, a term that encapsulates both the deferral of meaning and the differences that constitute language (Derrida 25). In the context of the "Me When I" meme, the incomplete caption exemplifies différance by leaving its meaning perpetually open-ended, inviting viewers to engage in an interpretive process that is never fully resolved.

The phrase “Me When I” functions as a fragment, a linguistic gesture that gestures toward meaning without ever arriving at a definitive conclusion. This incompletion disrupts traditional expectations of textual coherence and closure, aligning with Derrida’s critique of logocentrism—the privileging of fixed, stable meanings in Western thought. By refusing to complete the sentence, the meme resists the imposition of a singular, authoritative interpretation, instead creating a space for multiplicity and play. Viewers are compelled to fill in the gaps with their own experiences, emotions, or cultural references, transforming the act of interpretation into a participatory and dynamic process.

Derrida’s notion of the “trace” is also relevant to understanding how the meme operates. According to Derrida, every sign carries within it traces of other signs, creating a network of interrelated meanings that can never be fully disentangled (Derrida 65). The incomplete caption “Me When I” evokes a multitude of potential scenarios, each shaped by the viewer’s cultural and personal context. For example, one viewer might interpret the meme as a humorous commentary on corporate culture, while another might see it as a critique of digital communication’s fragmented nature. These traces of meaning, always present yet never fully realized, underscore the meme’s resistance to closure and its alignment with the principles of deconstruction.

The visual element of the meme further amplifies its deconstructive qualities. The low-resolution image of Tim Cook, with its pixelation and visual degradation, mirrors the incompletion and instability of the caption. Just as the text defers meaning, the degraded image resists the polished clarity typically associated with corporate branding, subverting the authority and coherence of its subject. This interplay between text and image creates a layered and self-referential artifact that embodies the principles of différance, challenging viewers to question their assumptions about meaning, representation, and authority.

Moreover, the meme’s participatory nature aligns with Derrida’s concept of the “open text.” In contrast to a “closed text,” which seeks to impose a fixed meaning, an open text invites readers—or in this case, viewers—to become co-creators of meaning (Derrida 78). The "Me When I" meme’s incomplete caption and ambiguous imagery encourage this kind of active engagement, transforming the meme into a site of collective interpretation and creativity. This participatory dynamic not only democratizes the process of meaning-making but also reflects the broader ethos of digital culture, where content is constantly remixed, reinterpreted, and recontextualized.

The meme’s resistance to closure also has broader implications for its cultural and aesthetic significance. By deferring meaning, the "Me When I" meme disrupts the linear, cause-and-effect logic that often underpins traditional narratives and representations. This disruption aligns with the postmodern condition, characterized by fragmentation, ambiguity, and the rejection of grand narratives. In this sense, the meme can be seen as a microcosm of the broader cultural shifts that Derrida’s philosophy seeks to address, challenging viewers to embrace uncertainty and multiplicity in their engagement with media and meaning.

Finally, the humor and absurdity of the "Me When I" meme further underscore its deconstructive qualities. The incomplete caption, when paired with the incongruous image of Tim Cook, creates a sense of irony and play that destabilizes conventional expectations of coherence and seriousness. This playful subversion aligns with Derrida’s emphasis on the importance of play in deconstruction, which he describes as a way of disrupting hierarchical oppositions and opening up new possibilities for thought and expression (Derrida 292). By embracing humor and absurdity, the meme not only critiques the structures and assumptions of digital culture but also invites viewers to participate in this critique through their own interpretations and responses.

In summary, Jacques Derrida’s theory of deconstruction provides a rich framework for analyzing the "Me When I" meme. Through its incomplete caption, ambiguous imagery, and participatory dynamics, the meme exemplifies the principles of différance, trace, and the open text, resisting closure and inviting multiplicity. By deferring meaning and embracing play, the meme challenges viewers to rethink their assumptions about language, representation, and authority, positioning itself as a complex and subversive artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.4 Ngai and Stuplimity: Affective Response to Absurdity

Sianne Ngai’s concept of “stuplimity,” introduced in *Ugly Feelings* and further developed in *Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting*, provides a compelling framework for understanding the emotional and aesthetic impact of the "Me When I" meme. Stuplimity, a term that combines stupefaction and sublimity, describes the paradoxical affective state elicited by phenomena that are simultaneously overwhelming and absurd (Ngai 271). The "Me When I" meme, with its low-resolution image of Tim Cook and incomplete caption, exemplifies this dynamic by evoking a mix of humor, confusion, and critical reflection.

At the heart of stuplimity is the tension between the ridiculous and the profound, a tension that is central to the meme’s affective resonance. The incomplete caption, “Me When I,” functions as an open-ended prompt that invites viewers to project their own interpretations, yet its lack of resolution creates a sense of absurdity that resists closure. This interplay between invitation and refusal aligns with Ngai’s description of stuplimity as an aesthetic experience that oscillates between engagement and frustration. The meme’s absurd incompleteness, far from being a flaw, becomes a source of its emotional and cultural power, compelling viewers to grapple with its ambiguity and participate in its meaning-making process.

The visual element of the meme further amplifies its stuplime qualities. The pixelated and degraded image of Tim Cook, stripped of the polished aesthetics typically associated with corporate branding, creates a visual dissonance that mirrors the textual incompletion of the caption. This dissonance evokes a sense of both familiarity and estrangement, as viewers recognize the iconic figure of Tim Cook yet encounter him in a form that subverts their expectations. Ngai’s concept of stuplimity captures this duality, highlighting how the meme’s visual and textual elements work together to produce an affective response that is at once humorous and unsettling.

Ngai’s theory also sheds light on the meme’s engagement with the broader cultural and aesthetic trends of post-ironic digital culture. In *Our Aesthetic Categories*, Ngai argues that categories like the zany, the cute, and the interesting reflect the affective and aesthetic sensibilities of late capitalism, where humor and absurdity serve as tools for navigating the contradictions of contemporary life (Ngai 178). The "Me When I" meme, with its absurd incompleteness and lo-fi aesthetics, exemplifies this sensibility by using humor and irony to critique the structures and assumptions of digital culture. The meme’s stuplime qualities, in this context, become a means of both coping with and critiquing the fragmented and incoherent nature of online communication.

The participatory nature of the meme further enhances its stuplime impact. By leaving the caption incomplete, the meme invites viewers to engage in a process of interpretation and completion, transforming them from passive consumers into active participants. This participatory dynamic aligns with Ngai’s emphasis on the relational and interactive dimensions of stuplimity, which she describes as an affective state that emerges through the interplay between the viewer and the object (Ngai 275). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness not only democratizes the process of meaning-making but also amplifies its emotional and aesthetic resonance, as viewers invest their own experiences and perspectives into the act of interpretation.

Moreover, the humor and absurdity of the meme serve as a form of affective critique, challenging viewers to question their assumptions about meaning, representation, and authority. The incomplete caption, when paired with the incongruous image of Tim Cook, creates a sense of irony and play that destabilizes conventional expectations of coherence and seriousness. This playful subversion aligns with Ngai’s observation that stuplimity often operates as a mode of critical engagement, using humor and absurdity to expose the contradictions and limitations of cultural norms and practices (Ngai 280). By embracing its own incompleteness and absurdity, the "Me When I" meme not only critiques the structures and assumptions of digital culture but also invites viewers to participate in this critique through their own interpretations and responses.

In summary, Sianne Ngai’s concept of stuplimity provides a rich framework for analyzing the emotional and aesthetic impact of the "Me When I" meme. Through its absurd incompleteness, visual dissonance, and participatory dynamics, the meme exemplifies the paradoxical affective state that Ngai describes as stuplimity, oscillating between humor and frustration, engagement and estrangement. By leveraging these qualities, the meme challenges viewers to rethink their assumptions about meaning, representation, and authority, positioning itself as a complex and subversive artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.5 Walter Benjamin and Aura: Reproduction and Digital Culture

Walter Benjamin’s seminal essay “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” provides a critical framework for understanding the implications of digital reproduction on cultural artifacts like the "Me When I" meme. Central to Benjamin’s argument is the concept of “aura,” which he defines as the unique presence of an artwork in time and space, tied to its authenticity and singularity (Benjamin 221). The advent of mechanical reproduction, Benjamin argues, erodes this aura by enabling the mass production and dissemination of artworks, fundamentally altering their cultural and aesthetic significance. In the context of digital culture, the "Me When I" meme exemplifies this loss of aura while simultaneously gaining new forms of cultural resonance through its reproducibility and participatory nature.

The "Me When I" meme, as a digital artifact, lacks the singularity and authenticity traditionally associated with Benjamin’s notion of aura. Its low-resolution image of Tim Cook, paired with the incomplete caption, exists not as a unique object but as a reproducible and infinitely shareable piece of digital content. This reproducibility, facilitated by the infrastructure of social media and digital networks, allows the meme to circulate widely and rapidly, reaching diverse audiences across cultural and geographic boundaries. In this sense, the meme embodies the democratizing potential of mechanical—and now digital—reproduction, making cultural artifacts accessible to a broader public.

However, the loss of aura in the "Me When I" meme is not merely a byproduct of its digital reproducibility; it is also a deliberate aesthetic strategy. The pixelation and visual degradation of the image, far from being incidental, serve to emphasize the meme’s status as a reproducible and participatory artifact. By embracing its own impermanence and reproducibility, the meme subverts traditional hierarchies of cultural value that privilege uniqueness and authenticity. This subversion aligns with Benjamin’s observation that mechanical reproduction challenges the authority of the original artwork, shifting the focus from the object itself to its social and cultural functions (Benjamin 224).

The participatory nature of the "Me When I" meme further complicates its relationship to aura. Unlike traditional artworks, which are often experienced in a passive and contemplative manner, the meme invites active engagement and reinterpretation. Viewers are not merely consumers of the meme but also co-creators, contributing to its meaning and circulation through acts of sharing, remixing, and recontextualizing. This participatory dynamic reflects the broader ethos of digital culture, where content is constantly remade and reimagined by its audiences. In this context, the loss of aura becomes a catalyst for new forms of cultural production and interaction, transforming the meme into a site of collective creativity and expression.

Benjamin’s ideas also shed light on the political implications of the "Me When I" meme’s reproducibility. In “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin argues that the loss of aura democratizes art by detaching it from its traditional contexts of authority and exclusivity, making it accessible to the masses (Benjamin 226). The "Me When I" meme, with its lo-fi aesthetics and absurd humor, exemplifies this democratizing potential by challenging the polished and authoritative imagery typically associated with corporate figures like Tim Cook. The degraded image and incomplete caption subvert the myth of corporate infallibility, inviting viewers to critique and reimagine the cultural narratives surrounding power, technology, and identity.

Moreover, the meme’s reproducibility enables it to function as a form of cultural critique, leveraging its accessibility and adaptability to engage with diverse audiences and contexts. Each iteration of the meme, whether shared on social media or remixed into new formats, contributes to an ongoing dialogue about its meanings and implications. This iterative process aligns with Benjamin’s vision of art as a dynamic and socially embedded practice, where the boundaries between creation, interpretation, and consumption are increasingly blurred.

However, the loss of aura in the "Me When I" meme also raises questions about the commodification and ephemerality of digital culture. While the meme’s reproducibility enables new forms of engagement and critique, it also subjects it to the logics of virality and monetization that characterize contemporary digital platforms. The rapid circulation and consumption of memes often prioritize novelty and immediacy over depth and reflection, creating a tension between the meme’s potential for cultural critique and its status as a disposable artifact of online culture. This tension underscores the ambivalent legacy of mechanical and digital reproduction, as both a tool for democratization and a mechanism of commodification.

In summary, Walter Benjamin’s concept of aura provides a nuanced framework for analyzing the "Me When I" meme’s relationship to digital reproduction and cultural value. By embracing its reproducibility and participatory nature, the meme exemplifies the democratizing potential of digital culture while also highlighting the tensions and contradictions inherent in its commodification. Through its lo-fi aesthetics, absurd humor, and iterative circulation, the "Me When I" meme challenges traditional notions of authenticity and authority, positioning itself as a complex and subversive artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.6 Susan Sontag and the Image: Interpretation and Ethics

Susan Sontag’s seminal works, *On Photography* and *Regarding the Pain of Others*, provide a critical lens for analyzing the visual and ethical dimensions of the "Me When I" meme. Central to Sontag’s argument is the idea that photographs are not merely representations of reality but are also interpretations, shaped by the intentions of the photographer and the context in which they are viewed (Sontag, *On Photography* 4). This dual nature of the photographic image is particularly relevant to the "Me When I" meme, where the low-resolution image of Tim Cook functions both as a visual artifact and as a cultural text open to interpretation.

The degraded, pixelated quality of the image in the meme exemplifies what Sontag describes as the aestheticization of reality through photography. By stripping the image of its original context and reducing it to a lo-fi, almost abstract form, the meme invites viewers to engage with it not as a straightforward depiction of Tim Cook but as a symbol laden with cultural and emotional significance. This aestheticization aligns with Sontag’s observation that photographs often serve as a means of transforming the banal into the extraordinary, imbuing even the most mundane subjects with a sense of meaning and importance (Sontag, *On Photography* 23). In the case of the "Me When I" meme, the visual degradation of the image amplifies its absurdity and humor, while also encouraging viewers to question the relationship between the image and its referent.

Sontag’s theories also shed light on the ethical implications of the meme’s visual and textual elements. In *Regarding the Pain of Others*, Sontag argues that images have the power to shape our perceptions of reality and influence our ethical responses to the world around us (Sontag 78). The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and incongruous image, disrupts conventional expectations of coherence and seriousness, creating a space for irony and play. However, this disruption also raises ethical questions about the use of Tim Cook’s image in a context that strips it of its original meaning and recontextualizes it for humorous or critical purposes. By appropriating Cook’s likeness without his consent, the meme engages in a form of visual and cultural critique that blurs the boundaries between satire and exploitation.

The ethical ambiguity of the meme is further complicated by its participatory nature. As Sontag notes, the act of viewing a photograph is inherently interpretive, shaped by the viewer’s own experiences, biases, and cultural context (Sontag, *On Photography* 85). The "Me When I" meme extends this interpretive process by inviting viewers to complete its meaning through their own captions and interpretations. This participatory dynamic democratizes the process of meaning-making, transforming the meme into a collective artifact of digital culture. However, it also raises questions about the responsibilities of viewers and creators in shaping the ethical dimensions of the meme. By engaging with the meme, viewers become complicit in its recontextualization and circulation, highlighting the complex interplay between agency, interpretation, and ethics in the digital age.

Sontag’s critique of the commodification of images also provides a valuable framework for understanding the meme’s role within the broader landscape of digital culture. In *On Photography*, Sontag warns against the tendency to consume images as commodities, stripped of their original context and meaning (Sontag 110). The "Me When I" meme, as a reproducible and shareable digital artifact, exemplifies this commodification, functioning as both a tool for cultural critique and a disposable product of online virality. Its rapid circulation and consumption on social media platforms underscore the tensions between the meme’s potential for subversive critique and its status as a fleeting, commodified object of digital culture.

In summary, Susan Sontag’s theories on photography, image interpretation, and ethics provide a nuanced framework for analyzing the visual and ethical dimensions of the "Me When I" meme. Through its degraded aesthetics, participatory dynamics, and ethical ambiguities, the meme exemplifies the complexities of digital culture, where images serve as both tools for critique and objects of commodification. By applying Sontag’s insights, we can better understand the ways in which the meme challenges traditional notions of representation, authority, and ethics, positioning itself as a multifaceted artifact of post-ironic digital culture.

## 6.7 Chapter Summary

The application of critical theories by Barthes, Derrida, Ngai, Benjamin, and Sontag offers a multi-layered understanding of the "Me When I" meme, illuminating its cultural and aesthetic significance within post-ironic digital culture. Each theoretical lens reveals distinct yet interconnected dimensions of the meme, highlighting its complexity as a cultural artifact.

Barthes’s exploration of mythologies underscores the meme’s role in constructing and deconstructing cultural myths. By pairing an incomplete caption with the image of Tim Cook, the meme disrupts traditional signification, inviting viewers to interrogate the cultural narratives it evokes. Derrida’s deconstruction further deepens this analysis, emphasizing the meme’s resistance to closure and its embrace of multiplicity. The incomplete caption exemplifies différance, deferring meaning and transforming the meme into an open text that thrives on viewer participation.

Ngai’s concept of stuplimity captures the affective resonance of the meme, oscillating between humor and frustration. The absurdity of the incomplete caption and the lo-fi aesthetics evoke a paradoxical emotional response, reflecting the fragmented and incoherent nature of digital communication. Benjamin’s notion of aura provides another layer of insight, framing the meme as a product of digital reproduction that democratizes cultural production while grappling with the tensions of commodification and ephemerality.

Finally, Sontag’s theories on photography and ethics illuminate the visual and ethical dimensions of the meme. The degraded image of Tim Cook, stripped of its original context, becomes a site of aesthetic and cultural critique, while also raising questions about the responsibilities of creators and viewers in the digital age. Sontag’s critique of commodification further situates the meme within the broader dynamics of digital culture, where images oscillate between tools for critique and objects of consumption.

Together, these critical theories reveal the "Me When I" meme as a multifaceted artifact that challenges traditional notions of meaning, representation, and authority. By embracing its incompleteness, absurdity, and reproducibility, the meme exemplifies the complexities of post-ironic digital culture, positioning itself as both a critique and a product of the digital age.
