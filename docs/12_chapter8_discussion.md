# Chapter 8: Discussion - Coherence, Collapse, and Digital Absurdism

## 8.1 Reassessing Coherence and Meaning in Memes

Memes, as a form of digital communication, operate at the intersection of coherence and incoherence, challenging traditional notions of meaning-making. The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and absurd imagery, exemplifies this tension by simultaneously inviting interpretation and resisting definitive understanding. This duality reflects broader dynamics in digital culture, where the rapid circulation and remixing of content often prioritize immediacy and affect over clarity and coherence.

Marshall McLuhan’s concept of the "medium is the message" provides a foundational framework for understanding how memes communicate through their form as much as their content. McLuhan argues that the characteristics of a medium shape the way messages are perceived and understood (McLuhan 7). In the context of memes, the fragmented and iterative nature of the medium inherently disrupts traditional expectations of coherence, creating a space where meaning is fluid and contingent. The "Me When I" meme’s incomplete caption exemplifies this dynamic by leaving its meaning open-ended, compelling viewers to engage in a participatory process of interpretation.

The tension between coherence and incoherence in memes also aligns with Jean Baudrillard’s theory of simulation and hyperreality. Baudrillard argues that in a media-saturated society, representations increasingly detach from reality, creating a hyperreal space where meaning is constructed through endless layers of signs and symbols (Baudrillard 6). Memes, as digital artifacts, operate within this hyperreal space, where their meaning is not fixed but constantly remade through acts of sharing, remixing, and reinterpretation. The "Me When I" meme, with its absurd and ambiguous elements, exemplifies this process by functioning as a simulacrum that invites viewers to project their own meanings onto the content.

The participatory nature of meme culture further complicates the relationship between coherence and incoherence. As Limor Shifman notes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes thrive on user engagement and reinterpretation, transforming them into collaborative texts that reflect the diverse perspectives of their audiences (Shifman 41). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness makes it particularly conducive to this participatory dynamic, as viewers are encouraged to complete the caption with their own narratives and interpretations. This process not only democratizes the creation of meaning but also highlights the inherently unstable and contingent nature of meme communication.

Examples from broader meme culture illustrate how the tension between coherence and incoherence shapes the way memes communicate. The "Surreal Memes" genre, characterized by its nonsensical and absurd imagery, deliberately eschews traditional notions of coherence to create a sense of disorientation and humor. Similarly, the "Deep-Fried Memes" aesthetic, which features heavily distorted visuals and text, leverages incoherence as a stylistic and affective tool. These examples demonstrate how memes use incoherence not as a flaw but as a feature that enhances their cultural and emotional resonance.

In summary, the tension between coherence and incoherence is a defining characteristic of memes as a form of digital communication. By drawing on the insights of theorists like McLuhan, Baudrillard, and Shifman, this section has shown how memes like the "Me When I" meme navigate this tension to create meaning that is fluid, participatory, and affective. Through their fragmented and iterative nature, memes challenge traditional expectations of coherence, positioning themselves as dynamic and subversive artifacts of digital culture.

## 8.2 Collapse of Meaning and Digital Saturation

In the contemporary digital landscape, the sheer volume of information produced and consumed has profound implications for how meaning is constructed, interpreted, and ultimately destabilized. Memes, as cultural artifacts of this saturated environment, exemplify the collapse of meaning that emerges from the overwhelming flow of digital content. The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and ambiguous imagery, serves as a case study for understanding how digital saturation fosters a condition of interpretive overload and semantic instability.

Jean Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality provides a critical framework for analyzing the collapse of meaning in digital culture. Baudrillard argues that in a media-saturated society, the proliferation of signs and symbols leads to a state where representations no longer refer to any external reality but instead circulate as self-referential simulacra (Baudrillard 6). Memes, as digital artifacts, operate within this hyperreal space, where their meaning is not fixed but endlessly remade through acts of sharing, remixing, and reinterpretation. The "Me When I" meme, with its deliberately incomplete caption, exemplifies this dynamic by inviting viewers to project their own meanings onto the content, creating a multiplicity of interpretations that resist coherence.

This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the dynamics of digital saturation, where the rapid circulation and remixing of content prioritize immediacy and affect over clarity and coherence. As Sherry Turkle notes in *Alone Together*, the constant bombardment of digital stimuli fragments attention and diminishes the capacity for deep, sustained engagement (Turkle 280). In the context of memes, this fragmentation manifests as a tendency toward surface-level engagement, where the rapid consumption and sharing of content prioritize emotional resonance over semantic depth. The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness aligns with this dynamic, as its ambiguity allows it to function as a flexible template for emotional projection rather than a coherent narrative.

The collapse of meaning in memes also reflects broader trends in postmodern media culture, as described by Fredric Jameson. In his analysis of postmodernism, Jameson identifies a condition of "depthlessness" in contemporary cultural production, where the distinction between surface and depth is eroded, and meaning becomes fragmented and dispersed (Jameson 12). Memes, as products of this cultural logic, embody this depthlessness through their iterative and participatory nature. The "Me When I" meme, with its minimalist structure and reliance on user-generated content, exemplifies this condition by foregrounding the process of meaning-making over the production of a stable, unified message.

The participatory nature of meme culture further complicates the relationship between digital saturation and meaning collapse. As Limor Shifman observes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes thrive on user engagement and reinterpretation, transforming them into collaborative texts that reflect the diverse perspectives of their audiences (Shifman 41). However, this participatory dynamic also contributes to the instability of meaning, as the constant remixing and reinterpretation of memes create a proliferation of competing narratives that resist resolution. The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness makes it particularly susceptible to this dynamic, as its ambiguity invites an endless array of interpretations that undermine the possibility of a singular, coherent meaning.

Examples from broader meme culture illustrate how digital saturation contributes to the collapse of meaning. The "Deep-Fried Memes" aesthetic, characterized by its heavily distorted visuals and text, exemplifies the erosion of coherence that emerges from the iterative remixing of content. Similarly, the "Surreal Memes" genre, with its nonsensical and absurd imagery, leverages incoherence as a stylistic and affective tool. These examples demonstrate how the saturation of digital content fosters a condition where meaning is not only fragmented but actively destabilized, creating a cultural landscape defined by semantic flux.

In conclusion, the collapse of meaning in memes is a defining characteristic of their existence within a digitally saturated environment. By drawing on the insights of theorists like Baudrillard, Turkle, Jameson, and Shifman, this section has shown how the "Me When I" meme exemplifies the dynamics of hyperreality, depthlessness, and participatory instability that characterize digital culture. Through their fragmented and iterative nature, memes challenge traditional expectations of coherence, positioning themselves as dynamic and subversive artifacts of a media-saturated society.

## 8.3 Absurdism in Digital Humor

Absurdism has emerged as a defining feature of internet humor, reflecting the chaotic and fragmented nature of digital culture. The "Me When I" meme, with its incomplete caption and ambiguous imagery, exemplifies the absurdist tendencies that characterize much of online humor. By embracing nonsensical and incongruous elements, internet humor challenges traditional expectations of coherence and meaning, creating a space where the absurd becomes a vehicle for both entertainment and cultural critique.

The philosophical roots of absurdism can be traced to thinkers like Albert Camus, who described the absurd as the tension between humanity’s search for meaning and the universe’s indifference to that search (Camus 28). In *The Myth of Sisyphus*, Camus argues that the recognition of this tension can lead to a form of liberation, as individuals embrace the absurd and find meaning in the act of defiance itself (Camus 31). Internet humor, particularly in its absurdist forms, mirrors this dynamic by reveling in the nonsensical and the incoherent, transforming the lack of meaning into a source of creativity and engagement. The "Me When I" meme, with its deliberately incomplete structure, invites viewers to confront the absurdity of its open-endedness, finding humor in its refusal to conform to traditional narrative expectations.

Susan Sontag’s concept of camp provides another lens for understanding the role of absurdism in internet humor. In *Notes on Camp*, Sontag describes camp as a sensibility that values exaggeration, artifice, and the subversion of seriousness (Sontag 277). Absurdist memes, with their exaggerated and nonsensical elements, align with this sensibility by embracing the ridiculous and the over-the-top as a form of cultural expression. The "Me When I" meme’s minimalist absurdity can be seen as a digital iteration of camp, where the humor lies in its playful defiance of conventional meaning-making.

The participatory nature of internet culture further amplifies the absurdist tendencies of online humor. As Limor Shifman notes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes thrive on user engagement and reinterpretation, transforming them into collaborative texts that reflect the diverse perspectives of their audiences (Shifman 41). This participatory dynamic often leads to the creation of increasingly absurd iterations of memes, as users push the boundaries of coherence and meaning in their quest for novelty and humor. The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness makes it particularly conducive to this process, as its ambiguity invites users to contribute their own absurd interpretations, creating a collective tapestry of nonsensical humor.

Examples from broader meme culture illustrate how absurdism functions as a core element of internet humor. The "Surreal Memes" genre, characterized by its nonsensical and dreamlike imagery, exemplifies the use of absurdity to create a sense of disorientation and humor. These memes often juxtapose incongruous elements, such as anthropomorphic objects or nonsensical captions, to create a surreal and absurd aesthetic. Similarly, the "Deep-Fried Memes" aesthetic, with its heavily distorted visuals and exaggerated effects, leverages absurdity as a stylistic and affective tool. These examples demonstrate how absurdism serves as both a creative strategy and a cultural critique, reflecting the fragmented and chaotic nature of digital culture.

The absurdist tendencies of internet humor also resonate with the postmodern condition, as described by theorists like Jean Baudrillard and Fredric Jameson. Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality, where representations detach from reality and circulate as self-referential simulacra, aligns with the absurdist logic of memes, which often revel in their detachment from conventional meaning (Baudrillard 6). Jameson’s analysis of postmodernism, with its emphasis on fragmentation and depthlessness, further underscores the cultural logic of absurdist humor, where the erosion of coherence becomes a source of creative potential (Jameson 12). The "Me When I" meme, with its minimalist absurdity, exemplifies these dynamics by transforming the collapse of meaning into a playful and participatory act.

In conclusion, absurdism is a defining feature of internet humor, reflecting the chaotic and fragmented nature of digital culture. By drawing on the insights of thinkers like Camus, Sontag, Baudrillard, and Jameson, this section has shown how the "Me When I" meme exemplifies the absurdist tendencies that characterize much of online humor. Through its embrace of nonsensical and incongruous elements, the meme challenges traditional expectations of coherence and meaning, positioning itself as a dynamic and subversive artifact of digital culture.

## 8.4 The “Me When I” Meme as Case Study of Digital Absurdism

The "Me When I" meme serves as a quintessential example of digital absurdism and the collapse of meaning in contemporary internet culture. By synthesizing the analyses of coherence, saturation, and absurdity explored in previous sections, this meme can be understood as a cultural artifact that encapsulates the fragmented, participatory, and nonsensical dynamics of digital communication. Its minimalist structure and open-ended caption invite a multiplicity of interpretations, positioning it as a site where meaning is both constructed and destabilized.

At its core, the "Me When I" meme exemplifies the principles of absurdism as articulated by Albert Camus. In *The Myth of Sisyphus*, Camus describes the absurd as the tension between humanity’s search for meaning and the universe’s indifference to that search (Camus 28). The "Me When I" meme mirrors this tension by presenting an incomplete statement that resists resolution, compelling viewers to confront the absurdity of its ambiguity. This open-endedness transforms the meme into a participatory canvas, where users project their own narratives and emotions onto the content, creating a collective tapestry of absurd interpretations.

The participatory nature of the "Me When I" meme also aligns with Limor Shifman’s observations on meme culture. In *Memes in Digital Culture*, Shifman highlights how memes thrive on user engagement and reinterpretation, transforming them into collaborative texts that reflect the diverse perspectives of their audiences (Shifman 41). The "Me When I" meme’s deliberately incomplete caption makes it particularly conducive to this dynamic, as its ambiguity invites endless reinterpretations that amplify its absurdist qualities. Each iteration of the meme becomes a new layer in a constantly evolving dialogue, illustrating the participatory instability that characterizes digital culture.

The collapse of meaning in the "Me When I" meme can also be understood through the lens of Jean Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality. Baudrillard argues that in a media-saturated society, representations increasingly detach from reality, creating a hyperreal space where meaning is constructed through endless layers of signs and symbols (Baudrillard 6). The "Me When I" meme operates within this hyperreal space, where its meaning is not fixed but endlessly remade through acts of sharing, remixing, and reinterpretation. Its minimalist structure and absurdist elements exemplify the hyperreal condition, where the boundaries between reality and representation blur, and meaning becomes fluid and contingent.

Fredric Jameson’s analysis of postmodernism further illuminates the cultural logic of the "Me When I" meme. Jameson identifies a condition of "depthlessness" in contemporary cultural production, where the distinction between surface and depth is eroded, and meaning becomes fragmented and dispersed (Jameson 12). The "Me When I" meme embodies this depthlessness through its reliance on user-generated content and its iterative nature. By foregrounding the process of meaning-making over the production of a stable, unified message, the meme challenges traditional expectations of coherence and narrative structure.

Examples from broader meme culture provide additional context for understanding the "Me When I" meme as a case study of digital absurdism and meaning collapse. The "Surreal Memes" genre, with its nonsensical and dreamlike imagery, and the "Deep-Fried Memes" aesthetic, characterized by its heavily distorted visuals and exaggerated effects, both illustrate how absurdity and incoherence function as creative strategies in digital culture. The "Me When I" meme shares these qualities, leveraging its minimalist absurdity to create a space where meaning is both constructed and deconstructed.

The "Me When I" meme’s absurdist tendencies also resonate with Susan Sontag’s concept of camp. In *Notes on Camp*, Sontag describes camp as a sensibility that values exaggeration, artifice, and the subversion of seriousness (Sontag 277). The meme’s playful defiance of conventional meaning-making aligns with this sensibility, positioning it as a digital iteration of camp that uses absurdity as a form of cultural critique.

In conclusion, the "Me When I" meme exemplifies digital absurdism and the collapse of meaning through its minimalist structure, participatory nature, and alignment with broader cultural and philosophical frameworks. By drawing on the insights of thinkers like Camus, Baudrillard, Jameson, Shifman, and Sontag, this section has demonstrated how the meme operates as a dynamic and subversive artifact of digital culture. Its open-endedness and absurdity challenge traditional expectations of coherence and meaning, reflecting the fragmented and chaotic nature of the digital age.

## 8.5 Implications for Understanding Internet Culture

The absurdist nature of the "Me When I" meme offers profound insights into the broader dynamics of internet culture and communication. As a cultural artifact, this meme exemplifies how digital spaces have become arenas for playful subversion, participatory creativity, and the redefinition of meaning. Its absurdist qualities not only challenge traditional modes of communication but also reflect the evolving ways in which individuals engage with and make sense of the digital world.

One of the key implications of the "Me When I" meme’s absurdist nature is its role in democratizing cultural production. As Limor Shifman notes in *Memes in Digital Culture*, memes thrive on user participation, transforming audiences into active creators who contribute to the iterative evolution of content (Shifman 41). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness exemplifies this dynamic by inviting users to complete its caption with their own interpretations, fostering a sense of collective authorship. This participatory model disrupts traditional hierarchies of cultural production, positioning memes as a form of grassroots creativity that reflects the diverse perspectives of digital communities.

The meme’s absurdist qualities also highlight the shifting boundaries between seriousness and play in digital communication. Susan Sontag’s concept of camp, with its emphasis on exaggeration and the subversion of seriousness, provides a useful framework for understanding how absurdist memes like "Me When I" operate (Sontag 277). By embracing nonsensical and incongruous elements, these memes blur the lines between humor and critique, creating a space where playfulness becomes a vehicle for cultural commentary. The "Me When I" meme’s minimalist absurdity exemplifies this interplay, using humor to engage audiences while simultaneously inviting reflection on the nature of meaning and communication in the digital age.

The participatory and absurdist nature of the "Me When I" meme also underscores the fragmented and fluid nature of identity in internet culture. As danah boyd observes in *It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens*, digital spaces enable individuals to experiment with and construct multiple facets of their identities (boyd 48). The "Me When I" meme’s open-endedness aligns with this dynamic by allowing users to project their own narratives and emotions onto the content, creating a multiplicity of interpretations that reflect the diverse identities and experiences of its audience. This process not only democratizes the creation of meaning but also highlights the ways in which digital culture fosters a sense of fluid and performative identity.

Moreover, the absurdist tendencies of the "Me When I" meme reflect broader trends in postmodern media culture, as described by theorists like Jean Baudrillard and Fredric Jameson. Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreality, where representations detach from reality and circulate as self-referential simulacra, aligns with the meme’s playful detachment from conventional meaning (Baudrillard 6). Similarly, Jameson’s analysis of postmodernism, with its emphasis on fragmentation and depthlessness, underscores the cultural logic of absurdist memes, where the erosion of coherence becomes a source of creative potential (Jameson 12). The "Me When I" meme exemplifies these dynamics by transforming the collapse of meaning into a participatory and subversive act, reflecting the fragmented and chaotic nature of digital communication.

Finally, the "Me When I" meme’s absurdist nature raises important questions about the future of communication in an increasingly digital world. As Sherry Turkle notes in *Alone Together*, the constant bombardment of digital stimuli has profound implications for how individuals engage with and process information (Turkle 280). The "Me When I" meme, with its minimalist structure and reliance on user-generated content, exemplifies the ways in which digital culture prioritizes immediacy and affect over clarity and coherence. This shift not only challenges traditional expectations of communication but also reflects the evolving ways in which individuals navigate and make sense of the digital landscape.

In conclusion, the absurdist nature of the "Me When I" meme offers valuable insights into the broader dynamics of internet culture and communication. By democratizing cultural production, blurring the lines between seriousness and play, and reflecting the fluid nature of identity, this meme exemplifies the transformative potential of absurdist humor in digital spaces. Its participatory and subversive qualities challenge traditional modes of communication, positioning it as a dynamic and reflective artifact of contemporary internet culture.
