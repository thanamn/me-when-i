# Acknowledgments

This thesis began, quite unexpectedly, as a passing comment during a conversation with my friend **Jeng** — a moment of shared absurdity that became the seed for a far more serious inquiry. I owe her my deepest thanks for that spark, as well as for her constant curiosity, good humor, and unwavering support throughout this journey.

Although this work was undertaken without a formal advisor, I am grateful to the many friends and colleagues who engaged with my ideas, challenged my thinking, and tolerated more conversations about meme structure than anyone should reasonably endure. Your presence shaped this work just as much as any academic framework.

Finally, I wish to acknowledge the wider internet community — the creators, remixers, lurkers, and weirdos — whose collective imagination continues to reshape the way we think, feel, and laugh online. This thesis is, in spirit, a tribute to that vibrant, chaotic cultural field.

Thank you all for making this possible.
