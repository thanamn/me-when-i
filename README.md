# "Me When I": A Serious Cultural and Theoretical Analysis of Incomplete Memes

**⚠️ Disclaimer: This is just a practice project where I'm trying to write like an academic about a meme I made. It's not a real thesis, obviously!**

So I made this terrible, absurdist Tim Cook meme that literally only me and my friend know about:

![Me When I meme](static/img/me-when-i-meme.jpg)

Then I thought it would be funny to write an entire academic paper analyzing it. I'm actually trying to use real academic methods to make it convincing, which turned into a good way to practice skills:

- Learning Docusaurus and web frameworks
- Academic-style writing
- Making content look professional
- General web dev stuff

Built it with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) because I wanted to learn how documentation sites work.

## Structure
